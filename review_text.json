[{"label": "positive", "text": "In my head, the purpose of this review is very clear. It is to convince YOU to read this book. Yes, you! Waste time no more. Go grab a copy.\n\nMachiavellian intrigue, mythology, religion, politics, imperialism, environmentalism, the nature of power. All this set in a mind-boggling, frighteningly original world which Herbert ominously terms as an \"effort at prediction\". Dune had me hooked!\n\n\n\nThe very first stirring I felt upon opening the yellowed pages of Dune was that of stumbling upon an English translation of an ancient manuscript of undeniable power and potence which had an epic story to narrate. The tone was umistakably sombre and I realized Herbert was not here to merely entertain me, he was here to make me part of the legend of . It was intriguing and challenging and heck, since I live for challenges I decided to take this one up too, gladly. The challenge was the complexity and depth of the plot, which left me perplexed, in the beginning. I knew there were dialogues which meant much more than their superficial meaning and was unable to grasp at it. I felt a yawning chasm between Herbert's vision and my limited understanding of it. However, of course, I plodded on and could feel the gap closing in with every page much to my joy and relief.\n\n\n\n\"To the people whose labours go beyond ideas into the realm of 'real materials'- to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this is dedicated in humility and admiration.\"\n\nThe foreword makes it pretty clear that Frank Herbert isn't kidding around. This is a serious effort at predicting how our world is going to look two thousand years from now and by God, it's a bloody good and detailed prediction. However, the real merit in this effort lies in the commentary on our lives in the present.\n\n\n\nThe setting of the book is arid futuristic. the plot is driven by political mind games reminiscent of The Game of Thrones. The issues he tackles are as modern as the colour television. Herbert's genius manifests itself in his ability to combine the past, the present and the future in one sweeping elegant move called Dune.\n\n\n\nDune is set in a futuristic technologically advanced world which after the (the bloody war between Man and Machines) has eliminated all computers and passed a decree declaring . Since there are no computers, the essential working of the galaxy is still and with heavy reliance on men and their dallying around. Lots of thriller potential right there. Men with superhuman analytical abilities called have taken the place of Computers. On the other hand, we have the , an ancient school of mental and physical training for female students (it gives them superhuman intuitive powers) who follow a selective breeding program which makes them feared and mistrusted through the Imperium. Their desired end product of this breeding program is the , a superman who\u2019ll be able to glimpse into the future. How he\u2019ll be able to do this is rooted in Herbert\u2019s idea of determinism: given that one can observe everything and analyze everything, one can effectively glimpse the future in probabilistic terms. Quantum physics anyone? The is the proposed solution to the male-female dichotomy, between the analytical and intuitive.\n\nThe plot of Dune is almost wholly set on the desert planet of (also referred to as Dune), an arid wasteland where water is so scarce that men have to wear stillsuits which recycle human moisture for further consumption. The source of the galaxy\u2019s interest in the planet is , a spice which bestows upon one longevity and prescient powers. Everything on the planet is permeated with the spice, the air, the sand, the food. Everybody on the planet is hopelessly addicted to the spice, their only hope for survival being their continued intake of the spice. The , the economic and trading monopolistic arm of the Galaxy badly needs the spice for interstellar transport. This is because their frigates travel faster than the speed of light and hence travel backward in time. The spice is the only way they can look into the future and see their way ahead. How cool is that! All the powers on the Galaxy are out to mine the spice, braving the sandworms, their name merely an euphemism, for they are gigantic 200 metre long creatures which always come digging through the sand whenever spice mining is undertook. . There\u2019s also another little glitch. There exist on the planet, the kickass native desert tribal , whom the foreign powers look down with suspicion and disdain. The ethos is one of survival and scarcity, driven by tribalism and egalitarianism. Okay, I\u2019ll stop right there. No more spoilers about this. Except that they value water to the extent that spitting on a person is the highest honour they can bestow upon him.\n\nOur protagonists are the family, consisting of the Duke, his Bene Gesserit concubine Jessica and their son Paul, who have been entrusted the stewardship of Arrakis. We discover the alien planet of Arrakis along with them, firstly with fear, suspicion and wonder and ultimately, love and respect. , however is no ordinary prince. There\u2019s a teeny weeny chance he might be the , something which troubles him constantly and gives us our conflicted hero. The poor chap over the spice and has visions of black hordes pillaging and murdering around town bearing his flag and sees his dead body multiple times.\n\nMy favourite character, however has to be the , the most evil character I\u2019ve ever come across in my literary excursions. He is ruddy ruthlessness, he is virile villainy, he is truculent treachery. He executes the inept chess players in his employ which says oodles about his badassery and his fondness for cold-blooded logic. He sees everything in simplistic terms. What is my best move? What is my opponent\u2019s best move? Is there anything I can do to completely squash his move? Is there a tactic which leads to mate in three?\n\n\n\nIn this setting, Herbert does so much, it\u2019s unbelievable. Religion, politics, the dynamic nature of power, the effects of colonialism, our blatant destruction of our environment are themes which run parallel to the intensely exciting and labyrinthine plot. He shows the paramount importance of myth making and religion for power to sustain over long periods of time.\n\n\n\nNow these are my thoughts about what Herbert could have meant to be Arrakis-\n\n\n\nIt makes perfect sense. Herbert draws heavy inspiration for the religious ideology of Muad\u2019Dib from Islam. He says \u201cWhen religion and politics ride in the same cart and that cart is driven by a living Holy man, nothing can stand in the path of such a people.\u201d which is the philosphy of the politics of Islam. Islamism in a nutshell.\n\nThe spice, much desired by everyone, is the oil. Baron Vladmir Harkonnen is symblomatic of the wily Russians. The Desert foxes Fremen are representative of the native Saudi desert-dwelling Bedouin tribe who have a strongly tribe-oriented culture and undoubtedly value water in equal measure. And the ultimate loser is the environment.\n\n\n\nI almost forget this is a science fiction novel, it\u2019s that real. It is also scary and prophetic. It is a reading experience that will leave you dreaming of the grave emptiness of Arrakis and make you wish you were there to brave it all in the privileged company of the noble Fremen. Frank Herbert achieves the pinnacle of what a sci-fi author aspires to rise to; authentic world building."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "Omg!

Basically all I remember is Sting and sandworms. I would love to watch it again and see if I understand it more after reading the book.\n\nI'm still not sure what all the spices were about on Arrakis. I keep thinking it's like their farming like we would farm corn or tobacco, etc. I could be wrong and I didn't get the connection between the spice and the sandworms. Is it like a drug to them? I did read in the back of the book that is was like a drug when taken in small quantities and really addictive when taken in large quantities and that Muad'Did felt his prophesies were because of the spice.\n\nI liked Duke Leto and I hated that he was betrayed not long after they got to Arrakis. There is always some twat out there causing trouble.\n\nI really enjoyed Paul's character and his mother Jessica.

I didn't really pay too much attention to the other characters or I guess I should say I didn't have many thoughts about them. With the exception of the ones that betrayed them.\n\nI really enjoyed when Paul and Jessica had to travel to get away from the evil Baron Harkonnen before they were killed too.

I don't doubt Dune was something special when it first came out in the 1960s. But reading it for the first time today, it feels horribly outdated to me and at times almost incomprehensible.\n\nI was warned going into this story that the beginning is extremely hard to understand, but that is an understatement. I could barely follow its scene after scene of dialogue referencing people and places and events, all with no explanation or context. It literally feels like I was just dropped into the middle of a book, and everything had already been explained elsewhere.\n\nBut it gets better, right? Well, only somewhat. A narrative does take shape, but the writing style remains confusing and obscure. It manages to be both long-winded and not clear enough, if you can believe that. Certain obvious points are harped on again and again, but other crucial ones are merely glossed over. Then, when you inevitably miss those important points, they create this cascading effect that keeps you mired in confusion.\n\nThe writing is also pretentious, with regular or nonsensical things consistently being presented in a profound way. There are plenty of extraneous paragraphs that sound good until you try to discern their meaning, at which point you'd be stumped. This sort of writing really confused me because I couldn't figure out which paragraphs mattered and needed to be dissected carefully to suss out their hidden meaning, and which ones are just adornment.\n\nAs for the story itself, it was a complete mismatch with my interests. I like science fiction with lots of real science. Instead, this is a space opera (a.k.a. a soap opera that takes place in space) with no actual science. It's all political intrigue, melodrama, doublespeak, and who has power over who, which I have zero interest in. I also couldn't care less about how fawningly amazing Paul is and how he is destined to be the chosen one.\n\nThis was such a frustrating reading experience because it could've been an amazing story. And there were moments in the beginning when I thought it was going in those creative directions. I was riveted during that infamous test in the first scene, only to realize that it was completely irrelevant to the rest of the story. Or to see where the book could take the scientific aspects of a desert planet and a population with so little water, which it didn't other than a bit of lip service.\n\nBut the book stubbornly chose to disregard these more interesting avenues, and instead took the most straightforward, boring route of making this into a story about power struggle. Well, we could've saved ourselves the bother and just stayed on Earth for that.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\u2727 \u2727 \u2727"}, {"label": "positive", "text": "Dune.\n\nNo other single syllable means as much to the science fiction genre, a single word that conjures images of sandworms, spice wars, great battles between rival dynastic families and a massively detailed and intricately crafted universe. No wonder this is widely regarded as not just a Science Fiction masterpiece, but a literary achievement as well.\n\nLike a study of Shakespeare, the reader finds that this is an archetype upon which many influences and imitators have based their works. The complexity and depth of the creation is staggering and I am continually astounded at the discipline with which Herbert must have focused his imagination.\n\nThis is the book upon which Herbert would base his greatest series and one that would outlive him as his son has continued to expand and add detail to the vast, immaculate tapestry woven by a true master of the genre. Encapsulating political, economic, sociological, biological, cultural and dynastic themes, Frank Herbert has set a high standard for later practitioners.\n\nBrilliant.\n\n***2015 reread - Read years later, this has lost none of its narrative power, if anything I can better appreciate the virtuoso attention to detail Herbert exhibited in his epic creation. From the perspective of having read his later 5 Dune sequels, I am astounded at the rich tapestry he has woven. Most impressive was his close omnipresence, analyzing the thoughts and minute actions and subtle nuances of his complicated dynamic interplay of characters. The exhaustive training of the Bene Gesserit and the intricate relations of the Houses and the Guild would stand as a monumental benchmark for speculative fiction ever since.\n\nThis time around I found myself looking more closely at the Harkonnens and will likely read some of Brian Herbert's additions to his fathers great work.\n\n***2019 reread - I'm even more in love with this book and am again in awe of Herbert's narrative skill. This time around I noticed that all of the quotes that begin chapters are from Princess Irulan and I paid close attention to how Herbert crafted these interludes.\n\nI also was drawn to the religious undertones that really began very early in the book and how Paul realized his gifts and was preparing for his role in the beginning chapters - all demonstrating Herbert's great narrative skill.\n\nFinally, I became more aware of what a great character was Gurney Halleck. While the ghola of Duncan Idaho dominated the later books, Herbert's creation of Halleck was an enjoyable and thought provoking addition to this masterpiece."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "There's a characteristically witty essay by Borges about a man who rewrites Don Quixote, many centuries after Cervantes. He publishes a novel with the same title, containing the same words in the same order. But, as Borges shows you, the different cultural context means it's a completely new book! What was once trite and commonplace is now daring and new, and vice versa. It just happens to look like Cervantes's masterpiece.\n\nSimilarly, imagine the man who was brave or stupid enough to rewrite in the early 21st century. Like many people who grew up in the 60s and 70s, I read the book in my early teens. What an amazing story! Those kick-ass Fremen! All those cool, weird-sounding names and expressions they use! (They even have a useful glossary in the back). The disgusting, corrupt, slimy Harkonnens - don't you just love to hate them! When former-aristo-turned-desert-guerilla-fighter Paul Muad'Dib rides in on a sandworm at the end to fight the evil Baron and his vicious, cruel nephew, of course you're cheering for him. Who the hell wouldn't be?\n\nSo that was the we know and love, but the man who rewrote it now would get a rather different reception. Oh my God! These Fremen, who obviously speak , live on a desert planet which supplies the Universe with melange, a commodity essential to the Galactic economy, and in particular to transport. a very subtle way to say \"oil\"! They are tough, uncompromising fighters, who are quite happy to use suicide bombing as a tactic. They're led by a charismatic former rich kid (OK, we get who you mean), who inspires them to rise up against the corrupt, degenerate... um, does he mean Westerners? Or only the US? And who Baron Harkonnen intended to be? I'm racking my brains... Dubya doesn't quite seem to fit, but surely he means ? Unless, of course, he's just a generic stereotype who stands for the immoral, sexually obsessed West. This is frightening. What did we do to make Frank al-Herbert hate us so much? You'd have people, not even necessarily right-wingers, appearing on TV to say that the book was dangerous, and should be banned: at the very least, it incites racial hatred, and openly encourages terrorism. But translations would sell brilliantly in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and a bad movie version would soon be made in Turkey.\n\nI honestly don't think Herbert meant any of that; but today, it's almost impossible not to wonder. If anyone reading this review is planning to rewrite , you'd better make sure you get your timing right. Who knows how it will be interpreted five years from now?"}, {"label": "negative", "text": "No one should argue the importance Dune. It laid the foundations for a great deal of the themes and constructs in modern science fiction. Frank Herbert was as important to the genre as Isaac Asimov and Arthur Clarke. Unfortunately, just like them, he's quite dated, and his books can be a labor to read. One thing he maintained from old science fiction was prim and scientific dialogue that no one would ever actually speak. I've known many scientists, and they don't talk like this. You're not going to convince me a child does.\n\nThe stuffy dialogue is inserted into even stuffier narrative, until it feels like nothing is organic about Herbert's prose. This is a terrible tragedy when you've got a world that he put so much effort into building - and it is an amazing feat of world-building, technically interplanetary building. But unlike J.R.R. Tolkien, who he is so frequently compared to, Herbert didn't make sure to include a great story in his world. Instead he included a story that frequently illustrated how clunky an artificial world can be, even if it's lovingly crafted. I struggled to attach or find interest in anyone, yet they're more archetypes than human beings, whose logic races past modern skepticism and whose dialogue is cloyingly artificial, the way people cared for the Hobbits, Dwarves and Rangers. In his world-building, Tolkien at least saved himself from being dated by antedating himself, and even with his illuminated prose, wrought more characteristics in just one protagonist than all of 's cast.\n\nEven the political intrigue Herbert tries to fall back on was overdone in the Spy genre decades before he started this book. All fans of the \"Genre\" genres should appreciate Herbert's massive contributions, but they shouldn't pretend to enjoy the books if they don't, and they should be wary of certain pitfalls typical of science fiction that survived into his landmark work."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "If you are having a hard time reading Dune:\nhttps://youtu.be/UMTRoZNN4E0\n\nMy YouTube Review (admittedly totally Fangirling):\nhttps://youtu.be/JilubCWr9Kk\n\nThis was one of the best books that I have ever read which I was not expecting at all.

Easily the number one book I've ever read. :)\n\nI waver, sometimes, but right now, it is my absolute favorite. :)\n\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nThis is a phenomenal classic of literature.\n\nIt's not just science fiction. It transcends science fiction, as a fascinating discussion of free-will versus inevitability. Can the Jihad be denied? Can Paul ever really avoid his own death, despite seeing every time-line play out with him as the butt of every cosmic joke? Can even cruelty or mercy even remain comprehensible after such knowledge?\n\nYes, I think this work outdoes Nietzsche. It certainly does a great job of making us care about the question.\n\nIs this all? Is this just a work that pays great justice to philosophy of action and inaction?\n\nOr is the novel merely a clever play at turning the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle into the physical embodiment of a man? It is that, of course. The Kwisatz Haderach can be many places at once, and he can be both alive and dead at the same time just like that certain cat.\n\nIs the novel a coming of age tale, first set as a mirror against his father Leto, only then to mirror the whole universe that had just turned against him? Yes, of course. He was, after all, both the product of all his upbringing and his genes, embodying the question of nature versus nurture. He was taught within many schools of martial arts and assassins, as well as training the mind in both the schools of the Mentats with their pure logic and that of the mystics, the Bene Gesserit, that allows complete control over the body down to the cellular level. And if this training wasn't enough, he was deeply schooled in politics, leadership, and the meaning of loyalty. The boy was raised right. Of course, that is nothing without ninety generations of genetic bloodline tampering from the Bene Gesserit, right? To become the fulcrum between cellular memory, tapping the minds and lives of all your genetic ancestors as well as tapping the ability to fold time and space, to become the eye of a storm of time.\n\nWhat a damn brilliant setup for one tiny character, no? His training links to the unlocking of his genes and to the life-extending and enveloping spice, Melange, to make him not merely aware of time in a theoretical sense, but eventually to be unable to discern what was in the past, the present, or the future. Here's a true Super-Man, well beyond Nietzsche.\n\nAnd don't believe for one second that this serious discussion about what would make a superior man makes for dull reading. No. We've got PLOT that's probably some of the most exciting and visceral in all of literature, driving us right into the web of intrigue, vengeance, treachery, and galactic politics.\n\nTo quote the text, we've got \"Plans within Plans,\" and it hardly stops there. We know the House Atreides is falling into a trap laid by the Emperor and House Harkonnen, and yet free-will and pride prevents any chance to avoid it. The setup is brilliant and extremely political, giving us character sketches of some of the most brilliant and memorable characters of all time.\n\nDuke Leto, the Red Duke, the most honorable and beloved leader.\nDuncan Idaho, the emotional and intuitive hero.\nGurney Halleck, archetypal loyalist and troubadour.\nLady Jessica, the woman who ought to have had all honor in life, but was unjustly reviled and set aside for political necessity. (Chani being both her mirror and her eventual glory.)\n\nAnd of course, my favorite character of all time, Paul Muad'dib Atreides, the one that would prevent the greater evils he foresaw, and went to enormous lengths and sacrifice to achieve, but who eventually failed in his task because even a god cannot overcome destiny. (Or the will of so many minds set as one.)\n\nSo damn brilliant.\n\nFrank Herbert spent five years writing this treasure, working and reworking it until he published it at age 25. None of his other works come close to this masterpiece, and there's little wonder. It was birthed, fully-formed, like Athena from Zeus's head, with enormous forethought and care.\n\nThe worldbuilding was just as carefully formed, from the ecology of Arrakis and the life-cycles of the sandworms, to the history and the creation of the Fremen from their mild beginnings as Zensunni Wanderers, adherents to the Orange Catholic Bible, to their history of oppression so like those of those who are Jewish, to their settling and hardening of their bodies and souls in the wastes of Arrakis, also just like the Jewish who carved out a place for themselves in Israel. (Current politics aside, this was a very potent idea before 1965 when Herbert wrote this, and indeed, the core is still just as powerful when you turn it back to Muslims.)\n\nThe Galactic culture is rich and detailed. The CHOAM economic consortium, with their monopoly on space travel and their need for the Spice to allow them to see a short period into the future to plot a safe course before folding space. The Empire is caught on a knife's edge between a single power and every other House who sit in the possibility of putting aside all their squabbles for the sole purpose of checking the Emperor, if they so desired. (And Duke Atreides was such a possible popular leader among all the Great Houses, which was the primary reason the Emperor wanted him dead.)\n\nAnd of course, we have our Villains.\n\nThe Baron Harkonnen has always been a crowd pleaser. Brilliant in his own right, devious and able to corrupt anyone with just the right sorts of pressure, including a certain absolutely trustworthy doctor we might mention.\n\n\"The Tooth! The Tooth!\" -- You can't handle the Tooth!\n\nFeyd Rautha Harkonnen is especially interesting for the question of nature versus nurture.\n\nThe Bene Gesserit had intended him to mate with Paul, who should have been Leto and Jessica's daughter, and that offspring should have been the cumulation of ninety years of a breeding experiment to recreate the Kwisatz Haderach which had come about almost by accident during the Butlerian Jihad in the deep past, to overthrow the AI overlords.\n\nHe was practically Paul's genetic twin, or at least, his potential to be the \"One who can be many places at once\" was on par with Paul. But instead of fulfilling the kind of destiny that we get with Paul, we see him grow up under the auspices of his Uncle the Baron, becoming as cruel and devious as he was deadly. He was the argument of nurture in the conversation, of course, and having so very little of it eventually cost him his life.\n\nI often wonder about the directions that Dune could have taken, all those little paths in time and circumstance that could have been. What if Feyd had been brought to Arrakis earlier and overwhelmed with Spice the way that Paul had? Sure, he wouldn't have been able to convert the unconscious changes into conscious manipulation, but he might have had enough glimpses of the future, the way that the Fremen did, to have given him the edge he would have needed to kill Paul.\n\nAnd then there's a relatively minor character, Hasimir Fenring, the Emperor's personal assassin, who was nearly the Kwisatz Haderach, himself. Unable to breed true, he was still potent enough to be completely hidden to Paul's time-sight in the same way that Paul was hidden from the Spacing Guild's weaker time-sight. His training as a skilled killer was also superior to Paul. He was, by all the hints and tricks in the tale, Paul's perfect downfall. It always gives me shivers to think about, and it was only in a single instant of both recognition and pity from Paul that stayed Fenring from killing our hero. It was just a moment of whim.\n\nThe setup was gorgeous. Paul's pity, had it been missing at his moment of greatest triumph over the Emperor, would have meant Paul's assured death. I still wonder, to this day, what stayed Frank Herbert's hand from killing his most wonderful darling. We knew the pressure of religion and politics was going to have its way upon all the oppressed peoples of Dune. The return of a monstrous religious Jihad was going to happen one way or another, sweeping across the galaxy and toppling the Empire, regardless of Paul's frantic plans and desires. Paul's own death would only mean a higher level of fanaticism, and Frank Herbert's warning against unreasoning devotion would have been made even clearer with Paul's death.\n\nPerhaps it was pity that stayed his hand. Who are we to say who lives and who dies?\n\nIf you really think this review is overlong, then I apologize, but please understand that I could absolutely go on and on much longer than this. It is a symptom of my devotion to this most brilliant of all tales.\n\nAnd yes, it still holds up very, very well after twelve reads. I am quite shocked and amazed."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "Update 2 March 2024\nI saw Dune 2 and the first one is nothing compared with it. Actually, most movies are nothing compared to Dune 2.

A masterpiece of SF with which I will probably compare all SF books that I\u2019ll read in the future. It goes in my favorites shelf.\n\nThis is my 3rd attempt to read Dune and I am really grateful that I did not succeed the first two times I tried as I was too young to understand all the subtleties. I would have probably enjoyed it as a very well written adventure novel but nothing more. That would have been a pity as Dune is so much more than a story about space travel and epic battles between good and evil. It presents complex philosophical ideas, explores ecological issues, cultural identity and differences. Also a major theme is represented by religion and religious leadership.\n\nThe disturbing part about this book, taken in the current political context, is how easily the Fremen can be identified with an Arab nation. The spice can be seen as \u201coil\u201d and the Harkonnens as evil westerners/Russians that are exploiting the natural resources without thinking about the locals and the environment. I saw that others reviewers saw this as well."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "\u2018Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.\u2019\n\nThe sheer scope and magnitude of this 1965 sci-fi drama is staggering, populated with an extensive cast of characters and a rich universe full of well-rounded lore, intricate politics where every actions is revealed as \u2018plans within plans within plans,\u2019 and dynamic cultures all set on a collision course of plot that rightfully earned it a wide readership and canonization as a \u201cClassic\u201d work. I found it lived up to the hype and opened itself up more upon a reread, validating the fond memories I had of it from reading it first as a young teenager smitten with anything sci-fi. This book has zero chill and everything is to extreme and epic levels, including the size of worms. But come for the Bene Gesserits, best part. While there isn\u2019t much to say that likely hasn\u2019t already been said better, I still want to pause and reflect on some key elements in . This is such a well-crafted book that addresses themes of power, religion, historical records as mythmaking and environmental concerns in a narrative about proxy wars and power struggles that speak just as loudly today as it did about 1960s foreign policy. If you are looking for a book of epic proportions, you can\u2019t go wrong with .\n\nThe best part about this book, to me, is the way it is constantly expanding. There is great world-building and a rich lore that recalls my glee first exploring , but what really excites me is the way Herbert reveals it all. The book starts so small\u2014a visit to a cottage from an old woman that seems like such a small scale fairy tale on page one\u2014and swiftly becomes gargantuan and never stops growing. It leaves you constantly feeling yourself shrink beside a universe always revealing itself as more complex than you had realized. I enjoy the way Herbert only gives you the minimum of what you need to understand and lets it all slowly unfold when necessary.\n\n\u2018\u2019\n\nFor newcomers, the basis of the book is that Paul has been quite literally bred to be a messiah and is engulfed in a difficult power struggle over a planet that essentially upholds the interplanetary economy through mining an addictive substance called \u201cspice\u201d. You might quickly find yourself thinking of spice as oil and the planet Arrakis as Middle East and Northern Africa (Tor put out a really ), you know, since there was a whole Cold War going on at the time and giving the villain Baron Harkonnen a first name like Vladimir might make you wonder if this is all an elaborate metaphor. The Baron saying \u2018\u2019 might make you think of the three branches of US government. You get the idea. There are also WWII holdovers present, such as the Sardaukar as an elite fighting force trained on Salusa Secundus to make sure you catch the S.S. reference. That\u2019s all very much there, but this book is so much more than a simple sci fi rendition of the Cold War and Herbert definitely wants you to apply these themes to our larger political and religious global interactions.\n\n\u2018\u2019\n\nAnother aspect I find fascinating in is the depiction of Paul Atreides in the \u2018chosen one\u2019 trope. Paul has reservations, though not due to thinking he doesn\u2019t deserve it (dude is royalty anyways, essentially) but because he fears what it will bring. Paul\u2019s powers are enhanced through spice and he is able to perceive the future, and in almost every possible scenario he sees nothing but mass war in his name:\n\nThe notion of precognition brings free will into question, particularly when a certain individual appears in visions of the future but dies before it happens. It becomes a universe where individual free wills are all acting upon one another in an attempt to control the narrative of time.\n\nHistory is written by the winners, or so the saying goes, and much of this novel focuses on the way the narrative of time is constructed through the mythologizing of people and events. \u2018\u2019 Jessica says to Chani, assuring her that her role as the lover to Paul will not be usurped by the princess he marries for the throne. Much of the book shows the dynamics between Paul as the Man and Paul as the myth, with characters like Stilgar recognizing that by being in service to the myth they too will be immortalized in the stories. Narratives become a form or power, and, as I\u2019ll discuss soon, can be a form of control.\n\nPerhaps it is because power and control are so central to this novel that it feels so very timeless and just as applicable to 2021 as it did to 1965. In regards to power, leadership also becomes another key theme. \u2018\u2019 House Atreides Duke Leto says, \u2018\u2019 a sentiment later echoed with all the same key terms by Baron Harkonnen. The two leaders are set up at the start as foils to each other, each trying to have their grip on Arrakis (there are some strong colonialism themes in this book and it delves into how troubling it is and how even those we might view as the savior turn out to be just another oppressor and colonizer) but their leaderships are defined by Leto\u2019s rule through caring for his people while Harkonnen sees everyone as a useful pawn.\n\nHaving recently finished , I could have preferred some more voices in this book looking for better forms of ruling that don\u2019t involve exploitation, but that\u2019s not what this book is about so I\u2019ll move on. What this book really focuses on is the ways power can be maintained, which crops up most in this novel through use of religion. \u2018\u2019 we read, and the harsh life on Arrakis makes it the perfect setting where indoctrination of religion for the purpose of power can shape a community and unite them. Religion is a form of storytelling, having the people all believe in one shared story with all its myths and promises. \u2018\u2019 Jessica instructs Paul, \u2018\u2019 The stronger the shared faith, the more easily a leader can make them do what they need. It also helps that everyone is high as shit all the time. \u2018\u2019 Kynes's father says:\n\nReligion is being used constantly to shape the people for the purpose of their leaders, even in what seems an admirable purpose of turning desert Arrakis into a green paradise (and without a religious idea of paradise, how can a people who only know dry dirt and hardship even imagine a paradise?).\n\n\u2018\u2019\n\nThis latter bit is also extremely key to Dune. The planet itself is practically a character in the novel, much in the ways the landscape is like a character in Westerns. The landscape of Arrakis truly shapes the people there, and we see a contrast between Arrakis and Caladan and how water as a precious resource on Arrakis changes many customs. Such as how spitting at a person is a sign of respect on Arrakis. Changing the environment on Arrakis is an interesting concept because, in order to make it thrive, what would the cost be? Would it disrupt spice, thereby collapsing the galaxy\u2019s economy? Can these people ever be free, because doing so would require the complete dismantling of the governmental systems currently ruling? Can I try this spice? I would like to try the spice.\n\nThere is also something to be said about the harshness of an environment being an ideal place for strenght in unity around a cause to crop up. Le Guin explores this in as well, with the anarchist planet having a similar dry desert vibe as Arrakis and scarcity being a major player in what keeps the people bonded and working together. The Fremen are tough because of their environment, similiarly the Sardaukar are trained in extremely harsh environments as well. plays a lot with ideas on how fascism and strongmen can quickly rise to power in times of economic instability\u2014or the threat of it\u2014and here the difficult planets tend to produce the most deadly fighters. Mix religion in and you have an instant army if you can convince everyone you are the chosen one.\n\nThere is so much more to discuss in this book, particularly the Bene Gesserits and the Guild who are pulling a lot of strings, or just how friggen awesome the worms are. This is a big book with a lot of big ideas, and also a lot of ambiguity to them that I really appreciate. It is certainly a precursor for a lot of popular epics to follow. George Lucas certainly took notes and I imagine read this and said \u201cwait, you can just beloved characters that easily!?\u201d before rewriting Duke Leto as Ned Stark. While I can concede to those who find it boring and dry, I rather enjoyed all the history and lore and found this to be incredibly fun."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "Ok, my only reference for Dune was the 1984 movie with Kyle MacLachlan.

Dune took the Space Opera and asked if it might be more than spandex, dildo-shaped rockets, and scantily-clad green women. Herbert created a vast and complex system of ancient spatial politics and peoples, then set them at one another's throats over land, money, and drugs.\n\nDune is often said to relate to Sci Fi in the same way that Tolkien relates to Fantasy. I'd say that, as far as paradigm shift, this is widely true. Both entered genres generally filled with the odd, childish, and ridiculous and injected a literary sensibility which affected all subsequent authors.\n\nFew will challenge the importance of Star Wars' effect on film and storytelling in general, but without Dune, there would be no Star Wars. Princess Alia, the desert planet, the Spice, the Bene Gesserit, and Leto II all have direct descendants in the movies. It is unfortunate that Lucas seems to have forgotten in these later years that his best genius was pilfered from Herbert, Campbell, and Kurosawa.\n\nThough I have heard that the later books do not capture the same eclectic energy as the first, Dune itself is simply one of the most original and unusual pieces of Sci Fi ever written. Read it, Starship Troopers, Ringworld, Neuromancer, and Snowcrash and you'll know everything you need to about Sci Fi: that you want more."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "2021 Reread - 5*\n\nI was totally blown away by the recent movie version of this, that much so I decided to revisit and revaluate my opinion of this extraordinary book.\n\nSo, I read it again six years on and this is something I said I would never do because I found it so difficult to read the first time. It wasn\u2019t the complexity of the world and politics, but the narration style which totally perplexed and frustrated me. Though I think that was more to do with my immaturity as a reader at the time than anything else. This is a difficult one, but it\u2019s worth it.\n\nThis time I was impressed with everything: the intelligence of the writing, the details of the world and the intricate nature of the storytelling. There\u2019s just so much brilliance here. And it\u2019s entertaining. It\u2019s interesting. The balance is perfect.\n\nThe Freman culture is driven by ideas of ecology, efficiency and waste reduction. And whilst they are not without their faults, the sense of oneness and appreciation they have for their home planet is a strikingly important commodity. I found them fascinating to read about and of the many thing this novel has going for it, they are the jewel in Herbert\u2019s crown.\n\nI want to see more of this world.\n\n\n\nI could never give Dune five stars because I really struggled to get into the novel in the beginning. It has taken me almost two months to read. This, for me, is a very long time to spend on a book. It took me so long to read because I found the writing style incredibly frustrating. I had to read whole chapters again so I could get the gist of the plot. This was more so in the beginning, which I found particularly hard to read because of the author\u2019s way of shifting between the thoughts of multiple characters. I found this very annoying; however, I persevered over my initial despondency towards the writing, and plodded on through the book. I\u2019m glad I did so because in the end I did come to really enjoy it. Indeed, the story is fantastic, but the writing will always remain unbearable for me.\n\n\n\n\n\nis to science fiction what is to high fantasy; it is the novel that officially, and unarguably, defines the genre. The story begins with the house of Atreides accepting the Dukedom of the planet Dune. The former Baron has been ousted by the Emperor, and is no longer of consequence. Well, that is how it initially appears. Very early on it revealed that the whole thing is a political ploy to bring the house of Atreides to its knees. The Baron lies in wait, and is ready to strike against the new, and benevolent, approach the Duke uses on the Fremen.\n\nThe Fremen are the natives of the dessert planet; thus, they know how to survive its harshness above all others. They do this through their frugal approach to water. They value it above all else, and will never waste a drop in earnest. The Baron Harkonnen, as a chide against the natives, squanders water in the cruellest ways. He, and his dinner guests, throw cups of water on the floor of the dinner hall; it was his tradition. The wasted water was soaked up with towels, which the Baron allowed the Fremen to suck the water out of. When the Duke enters he rejects this custom, and is more respectful to the Fremen way of life. He and his son and heir Paul, who is the protagonist of this novel, go as far as to try the Fremen\u2019s grossly effective water saving suits. These Stillsuits, quite literally, recycle all the water the body wastes and feeds it back to its wearer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis early familiarity, with the Fremen technology, no doubt helps to keep Paul\u2019s mind open when he is later forced to live amongst the Fremen. Paul is somewhat of a marvel; he is prophecy\u2019s chosen one. When he eventually gains the trust of the Fremen they allow him to choose a Fermen name. He calls himself after their most revered prophet: Muad'Dib. They accept this and follow him as their leader. His inherited title of Duke dictates that he is their lord, but their religion determines their real loyalty. He has to, quite literally, fight for every ounce of their trust. Indeed, it does not come cheap, and will only be given to one who is a member of their people.\n\n\n\nThus, Paul becomes their saviour. Consequently, he receives heaps of character development through this book. He goes form boy to the revered leader of a nation. The Fremen, like Paul, want the evil Baron Harkonnen gone from their planet. They do no want a cruel oppressor who is ignorant to their ways: they want Paul. I think the imagination behind the Fremen culture really is wonderful. They have efficiently adapted to survive their harsh planet. To emphasise this point you need only look at the fact that off-world humans live in fear of the giant Sandworms that infect the planet whereas the Fremen ride them as a coming of age ritual. Indeed, Paul has to ride a worm if the Fremen are to follow him.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result of this is a very complex, and intriguing plot. I found the first third of this book to be very perplexing initially. This is a world we are told about rather than shown at the start. We hear about the Fremen but do not truly understand them till the very end. I was very overwhelmed at the beginning, and in all honesty I do think this novel merits a re-read to further establish my understanding of it. This did affect my rating because it inhibited by enjoyment of the book.\n\n\n\nIndeed, aside from Paul there is a whole host of dynamic, and well rounded, characters. His mother is to be the new revered mother of the Fremen people, which for someone of her age is quite remarkable. There is also the captain of Duke Leto\u2019s household guard who is a very deep and honourable individual. As much as I came to like these characters I was still frustrated with the writing of them in the beginning. I found it difficult to read scenes in which up to four characters internal thoughts are portrayed alongside their dialogue. It wasn\u2019t always clear who was thinking. I much prefer a narrative that is focalised through one person. Well, at least one person per chapter.\n\n\n\nOverall, I thought the idea behind this novel was utterly fantastic. However, my personal reaction to the writing style limited my overall enjoyment of the book. I do intend to read some of the sequels. However, I do not have any intention of doing so in the near future. Maybe, in a couple of years I will return to the brilliant, and annoyingly written, world of Dune.\n\n__________________________________\n\nYou can connect with me on social media via .\n__________________________________"}, {"label": "positive", "text": "Why You Should Read Dune (video): https://youtu.be/oOomSvGXfaM\n\nAsking me to describe why Dune is so important to me is like asking a child to explain nuclear fusion. I do my best in the video linked above, but just know it probably isn't for the reasons you think.\n\nMy journey to Dune becoming my absolute favorite book of all time goes all the way back to the mid-1990's upon finding it in my high school library and deciding to give it a try because I remembered my dad and brother watching the movie when I was a kid. At 15 years old, I got to the middle of \"book II\" and gave it a big fat DNF. I decided it just wasn't for me. At 17, for the 30th anniversary, I decided to try again and while I finished it that time, I thought the ideas were overly pretentious and way too out there. But a year went by and somehow, it was still in my head. I thought about it frequently and I began to ponder...did I actually really like it?\n\nI tried again the final weeks of my senior year of high school and became absolutely obsessed and it has stayed that way for almost the last 25 years.\n\nDune is social science-fiction in that it's more concerned with the people and society than it is with hard science. Besides telling you that these navigators \"fold space\" for interstellar travel, Herbert doesn't bog you down with the math. He focuses more on the politics, cultures, religion, and philosophies of a world rich in the most valuable resource in the known universe, but barren in everything else.\n\nIf you go into the story expecting a Star Wars style adventure, you're going to leave disappointed. Dune is extremely thought provoking and deals with the struggles of coming of age while the fate of the universe is on your shoulders.\n\nI'll also say that the book is certainly not for everyone. If you love things like ASOIAF and The Wheel of Time, there is no way this book won't be for you as both of those series borrowed heavily from the story Frank crafted. But I think it truly depends on where you are at in your life. Look, I just told you the story of how it took until my third reading for this to really click with me. Those who the story and lessons click with, it REALLY clicks with. But, again, this isn't a crowd pleaser and not everyone is going to love it, especially modern readers. So while I encourage those that are interested to read it, I expect more modern readers to not like it than like it.\n\nNot only is this the greatest science-fiction story of all time, but I believe it should be on mandatory reading lists in schools and everyone interested in the genre owe it to themselves to read the pillar of the genre they have come to love.

We love our ideas of ideal benevolent rulers who can set things right, don\u2019t we? Or the martyr figures inspiring \u201crighteous\u201d battles? Messiahs and figureheads seem to fulfill the deep-seated cultural longing for an inspirational leader, don\u2019t they? .\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, in Frank Herbert hints at the dangers present in such ideas.

Religious fanatics are destined to wage a brutal war that the Messiah is unable to stop.\n\n\n\nAll this is gently hinted at, laid out in the framework of the appealing Hero\u2019s journey. It seems that should you desire, you can still easily choose to read it as a typical hero\u2019s/antihero\u2019s story, just less idealistic than it could be.

Together with the spice, this elite mental mind control academy with the aim to finally create the ultimate space JC messiah figure to defecate rainbows, freaking galactic peace, pink unicorns, and gold, is the backbone of the whole trilogy, because impacts of both and the excessive use of it as MacGuffins and Chekhovs plot devices lead to the question:\n\nIs this still really sci-fi or not more a high fantasy thing with some sci-fi elements?\nWell, highly subjectively, yes, Dune is mostly psi fantasy dressed in futuristic clothes with some faith, tech, technobabble (rare), and trade in between, which makes it one of the most outstanding and unusual sci-fi works, I mean fantasy camouflaged as sci-fi. Tricky, one is so indoctrinated to call this thing sci-fi that it took me a reread and absorbing many reviews to realize what\u00b4s really going on. I\u00b4m really not sure about this whole thing, I\u00b4ve read a ton of sci-fi and my alien mind parasite, in a kind of perverted symbiosis with the xenovirus making me look fresher I deliberately bought for this purpose like a tapeworm therapy to lose weight (you don\u00b4t want to know what this costs on the alien bioweapons black market, the second half of my immortal soul exactly), tells me that there still would a lot of story without the sci-fi elements, while close to nothing would be there after removing fantasy, faith, drugs, and mind penetrating abilities, so, yea. I mean, even the planet itself doesn\u00b4t really has sci-fi fractions or something, the space around it is kind of empty without many sci-fi parties, cyborgs, aliens, everything substantial seen in close to any big sci-fi series. This leads me to\n\nAn unpopular and possibly controversial opinion\nIt could be that Herbert is, and I am just talking about the sci-fi aspect, a bit overrated or, let\u00b4s precisely define it, overhyped as a sci-fi author because he is more of a fantasy writer. This couldn\u00b4t happen in a fantasy world, because parts of the legions of readers of the genre don\u00b4t want aliens and Clarketech mixed in their magic, not to speak of the suspension of disbelief problem that often comes with sudden future tech elements in fantasy, that\u00b4s just disgusting. The other way round, as with Dune, is much easier, just put some sci-fi around fantasy and everything just rolls perfectly.\n\nIs terraforming destroying cultural heritage or making inhabitable worlds paradises?\nThe ethical implications of this question are another sci-fi old school vehicle, especially if the terrible acid rain, high gravity, parasite infested, or dirty desert land is the only region where the special, red plotline device can grow and thrive. One could go so far as to ask if there are real life examples on earth, conservation vs corporate environmentalism, greenwashing and stuff (spoiler warning: conservation lost, earth is dying), and how this should be dealt with in decades, centuries, or millennia when we (I hope you are immortal too thanks to alien symbiont virus cooperation like me, if you aren\u00b4t, poor you, may I infect you? Just 20.000 of whatever your fringe financial system uses as fiat money that will be worthless as soon as natural apocalypse, mutually assured destruction, or alien invasion make it obsolete, and you get the parcel. Shipping not included.) start manipulating weather, geophysics and- chemistry, and climate of other worlds to make it sexy, tropical, tourist friendly paradises at the low cost of exterminating all alien life, but this would be a bit far fetched.\n\nHerberts\u00b4place in the sci-fi or sci-fa hall of fame.\nThat\u00b4s tricky, especially because he just couldn\u00b4t keep delivering after the third part. I\u00b4ve played around with the fourth and fifth part, but had to abandon it because it escalated to too much unmotivated, philosophical drivel without a real plotline and a place in the big picture of the series, Herbert just didn\u00b4t manage to hold it all together. What made the first three parts, that they are kind of eccentric, ingenious standalones without the classic space opera series uniting plotline and style, great, kind of destroyed the rest of the series. Because he had no more vision for the meta, high sci fa elements, Herbert lost control over his own creation and just manufactured hearthless shells to sell more books.\n\nBut that doesn\u00b4t mean that the first three parts aren\u00b4t milestones of the interdisciplinary genre, exploring it in new ways no one imagined before while reaching Lem-, Clarke-, and Asimov levels of subtle, intelligent dialogues, innuendos, connotations, and character driven development. It\u00b4s something unique, special, and definitively not for anyone because of its high entry barriers that may annoy some readers, but don\u00b4t let yourself be easily deterred by that, it\u00b4s totally worth it once you\u00b4re in and high as heck and addicted forever to the wonderful, delicious spice melange.\n\nTropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:"}, {"label": "positive", "text": "Dune is often considered a masterpiece of 20th-century American science fiction. In part, the book owes its reputation to the film adaptation David Lynch directed in the early 1980s (although this movie was, and still is, not considered one of his best). Frank Herbert wrote a novel of epic proportions, in other words, a space opera, with its intergalactic feudal society, its decadent (if not evil) empire and its band of rebels: the book was published some ten years before the first instalment of the Star Wars series. Indeed, along with Asimov\u2019s (overrated) stories, it was George Lucas\u2019 primary source of inspiration.\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of Herbert\u2019s creation is the multi-cultural world he depicts. Each house (Atreides, Harkonnen, etc.), each planet (Arrakis, Giedi Prime, Caladan...), each group (the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit, the Guild, the Emperor\u2019s suite and the Sardaukars) has its specific flavour, its own culture, its language \u2014 the comprehensive index at the end of the book is utterly fascinating. For each of these cultures, Herbert borrowed traits from traditions (ancient or contemporary) he knew well in reality, especially from the Middle East. In particular, Paul Atreides / Muad\u2019Dib\u2019s story among the Fremen is redolent of the historical events around T.E. Lawrence and the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire. And Paul\u2019s crusade on Arrakis is told, as though it were ancient history, in the chronicles at the start of each chapter.\n\nHerbert describes his fictional world and characters in great detail, which contributes to the richness of his narrative, but I found these descriptions somewhat boring and, especially, the middle of the book is a bit dragging for that reason. In my view, the most impressive parts of this novel are the dialogues, where Herbert simultaneously reveals what the characters are saying and thinking. This technique lends a sense of duplicity and scheming to almost every interaction. Everyone is plotting one way or another so that the whole thing ends up being like a great Shakespearean play, with dialogues and asides, tyrants and pretenders. What confirms this impression is not only the theme of the exiled Duke (see , , or ), but also the repeated scenes of fencing duels throughout, with feints and poisoned tips: a clear allusion to the endings of and , for instance.\n\n: A word about Denis Villeneuve\u2019s new film adaptation of Herbert\u2019s novel (part 1, 2021). Comparisons are odious and obviously wouldn\u2019t be to David Lynch\u2019s advantage. This is a version for a new generation of fans and an epic movie on par with Peter Jackson\u2019s trilogy, in the early 2000s. The settings (filmed in Scandinavia and the Middle East) are breathtaking, and the actors have so much going for them. But what strikes me the most in this new version is the sense that everything is overwhelming and sublime: the massive architecture, the crushing machines, the extreme weather conditions, the earth-shattering landscapes, the thunderous music, the tragic events, the repulsive foes. From the relenting waves of Caladan to the searing and unending skies of Arrakis, everything assumes an oceanic and staggering dimension."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "I blame the movie.\n\nI was an avid but novice fantasy and sci-fi reader in 1984 when David Lynch\u2019s Dune rolled out as a big-budget adaptation of the 1965 classic book. It was an artistic and box-office failure with Roger Ebert calling it \u201ca real mess, an incomprehensible, ugly, unstructured, pointless excursion.\u201d Numerous references were made to its excessive length, particularly a tv edition that was over 3 hours long. I never did pick up the classic sci-fi book, assuming the commentary heard about the movie applied to the book. All that changed when I broke my finger and found myself with a lot of extra time on my hands (groan).\n\nBesides,\n\n\n\nDune has a lot of ingredients that don\u2019t fit into my preferred stories, yet the gestalt was not only tolerable, but engrossing.\n\nIt begins with the Atreides family preparing to shift their holding from their current home to the planet of Arrakis. The Emperor has given the Atreides the territory and trade on the planet of Arrakis, formerly under control of their enemies, the Harkonnen. The planet Arrakis is hot, arid and generally hostile to life. There is, however, a small population of native, fierce Freman who have managed to build an existence in the desert.\n\n\n\nPaul Atreides is the young heir of the family, and mystical testing reveals he might be the one prophesied.\n\n\n\nPaul undergroes a rapid growth curve, facilitated by his teacher Dr. Yeuh and his father\u2019s advisors.\n\n\n\nBut it is in the desert that Paul will discover his strength as well as his new people.\n\n\n\nSeriously, now.\n\nHonestly, I have to wonder how much of this is generational. If Sanderson or Rothfuss wrote this book, two chapters in Dune would have made a whole book, and while detail may have been added, it likely would have made for a book as slow as the movie. I liked the scope of Dune, and that there is a resolution to the initial conflict. It is also interesting that despite the volume of concepts packed in here, with political maneuvers, terraforming, technology, cultural assimilation, and mysticism all playing roles that I didn\u2019t find it overwhelming, perhaps because so much is genre-familiar.\n\nOn the downside, it could have perhaps used a bit more transitions, particularly near the end when months at a time are skipped. Writing was solid; nothing really stood out, but it told the story well. There\u2019s some vague mysticism that might irritate those who like explanations. It was a bit of an eye-roller to have the chief villain be a fat, gay, sadistic pedophile, but Herbert really isn\u2019t thinking outside the trope character box much (it\u2019s not enough that he sentences people to death but he has to be physically abhorrent? And gay?). World-building is fun, but standard desert.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m glad that I finally took the time to read it and put those old assumptions to rest. I love a good hero."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "[UPDATED]\nI reread Dune for the first time in several decades and immensely enjoyed it. I also went back to watch the original cult feature film by David Lynch and had quite mixed feelings - while it was close to the overall aesthetic that Frank Herbert describes with the gorgeous desert sets and the terrifying worms, the parts of the story that were necessarily culled out was disturbing (that and the woeful special effects at the time trying (and IMHO failing) to visualize the personal shields that the characters wear in hand-to-hand combat).\n\nFor those who are just discovering Dune for the first time, it is essentially a messianic story on a desert planet (think of Jesus or perhaps Mohammed on Tatooine) in a universe dominated by a cartel (the Guild also known as CHOAM) with a monopoly on a drug (called m\u00e9lange) derived from a rare material (spice) available only on the desert planet Arrakis (Dune). This drug is so powerful that it allows the Guild (and later Maud'dib) to leverage space-time singularities to defy the speed of light and travel anywhere in the universe. Overlaid on this foundation, the epic battle of the feudal houses of the noble Atreides and the evil Harkkonen houses rages, the betrayal of the former by the latter explicitly endorsed by the Emperor (himself an almost impuissant pawn of the Guild as well). All that to say that the fabric of the story is multilayered and as complex and complete a universe as you will find in George RR Martin or Dan Simmons.\n\nThere are several enhanced human species running around: the Mentats who have been cerebrally enhanced to be able to calculate like supercomputers (computers themselves having been banned!) and each then uses their predictive analytics for their assigned Dukes (or the Emperor) and the Bene Gesserit cult who are a sort of quasi-religious non-celibate nuns who have honed perception and language to the point of having developed nearly superpower-level strengths of persuasion which are almost universally feared and vilified as sorcery in the rest of the universe. Paul Atreides, heir to the throne, is born to Jessica, a Bene Gesserit, possessed some of these powers and when the family moves to Arrakis (part of the aforementioned Harkkonen plot) from their home planet Caladon, he appears to the native Freeman population as perhaps a fulfillment of their messianic prophecies and hopes.\n\nIn perhaps the most critical departure from the book, the Lynch movie does not really show Paul questioning the awesome power that he possesses and his assumption of the mantle as the Arrakis Messiah, the Maud'dib (something that the 2021 film by Denis Villeneuve does thankfully address). In the book, one aspect that I loved was how Paul struggled with this messianic destiny and did everything he could to subvert it. One of the unique gifts he received, presumably as the rare and unique offspring of a Bene Gesserit, was the ability to see possible outcomes (like a Mentat) and thus he could take decisions based on the most likely foreseen outcome. It made for great reading.\n\nThe other great thing about Dune is the aesthetic of this desert planet with impossibly huge worms under the surface who are mysteriously connected to spice and pose a danger to all creatures in the desert except for the Freeman. The still suit which recycles body water in the deep desert was brilliant as was the ever-present obsession with \"water debt\" of the Freemen. I really felt like I was walking unevenly (must not attract the worms!) through the sand with Jessica and Paul before their fateful encounter with the Freemen.\n\nDune is a well-deserved classic for all the reasons I mentioned above and probably much more that I missed. I have read it twice and gotten almost entirely different things out of it each time. I have since read all the canonical Frank Herbert books in the series and enjoyed it all immensely.\n\n[UPDATE] I am looking forward to Denis Villeneuve's Dune in October 2021. The previews I have seen so far seem to be quite coherent with respect to the book. I was a fan of Lynch's Dune and am curious to see what Villeneuve does with this one. Feel free to comment below.\n[UPDATE] Villeneuve\u2019s 2021 film covers half of the book and does a fantastic job as both an homage to Herbert\u2019s book and Lynch\u2019s film. The casting, costumes, CGI, and script are all top-notch. Dune lovers have every reason here for rejoicing. One key difference from the Lynch film is that we do not see the Guild Navigators, so we can hope that they show up in the second half!\n[UPDATE 2024]\nI loved the 2nd DV adaptation especially the use of color and black and white as well as character arcs.

I\u2019ve been raking my brain for hours on how to properly explain the importance of Dune in the sci-fi literature but you know what? I dune (hehehe) think it\u2019s necessary for me to do so. If you truly wanna know why, you can search it on whatever search engine you use and you'll find hundreds of articles or reviews on why this book is that important; and they\u2019ll do a much better job than me. I won\u2019t even deny any of them because, in my opinion, this book was truly revolutionary. Dune didn\u2019t become the number one highest selling Sci-fi novel of all time for no reason; like Brian Herbert said, it is to Sci-Fi, what the LOTR trilogy is to fantasy.\n\nTheoretically, if I\u2019m reviewing this by putting my head as someone from 1960\u2019s or 1970\u2019s, I know I would think of this book as my bible. 1965 was the year when Dune was published for the first time, 24 years before I was born. There are just too many groundbreaking ideas, world-building, that would become the inspirations for many Sci-fi in our time; I only realized this after reading this book. I mean, the gigantic Sandworm alone has inspired many video games to use it as a common monster or enemy.\n\n\n\n\n\nDesert planet, Stillsuits, space exploration, and Zen Buddhism, Dune was truly a groundbreaking novel, almost everything in this book somehow seems prophetic because it has predicted our current society, especially when it comes to faith, emotional control, empathy, and the importance of ecology and scarcity.\n\n\n\nPart of what made this book was great for me was Herbert\u2019s prose. I haven\u2019t read enough classic to claim it was classical, but Herbert\u2019s prose was definitely unique to me. It has a lot of freedom by writing it from a limited omniscient narrative; changing POV\u2019s repeatedly in a single chapter without any warning. This is, honestly, one of my biggest pet peeves in my usual read, but Herbert made it work because all his characters were really well written, distinct in their personality, and the dialogues are really well dune (HEHEHE). Plus, there are so many motivational and extremely philosophical quotes that seem to make this book a combination of Sci-Fi & self-help book, such as:\n\n\n\nAnd of course, the most famous and one of the best quote I\u2019ve ever read out of any book\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t believe I have gone through life without knowing about this litany against fear. It\u2019s applicable in any kind of hardship we faced in real life, and I know it will be one of my motto starting from now. If I\u2019m judging this book solely from how significant this book was, I\u2019ll give it maximum score in a heartbeat. However, I\u2019m reviewing this based on one question and how I rated all the books I read:\n\nThe answer is yes and no, it was a mixed bag. The first part of this book was incredible, I couldn\u2019t put down the book and everything was so interesting and compelling. Then comes the second part, where the pacing just became really draggy and somehow, boring. However, my hope was restored for a while during the third act, until the anti-climax happened. My expectation is obviously at fault here but hey, this book is the number one highest selling sci-fi book of all time and one of the most highly acclaimed book, I expected there to be a mind-blowing climax sequences to close the book in an epic way. But no, there wasn\u2019t any. Not only it felt anti-climactic, Herbert\u2019s prose in describing settings and actions didn\u2019t age well or up to current standard. The main reason for this is that this is a book that relies heavily on character\u2019s dialogues to do everything; world-building, plot, characterizations were done solely through dialogues. This leads to the great plot but weak action sequences and no vivid settings. Sure there was some explanation on the settings, but other than the planet\u2014which is just a desert, just search Sahara or Planet Tatooine and voila\u2014the interiors were given only brief description, which makes it hard to imagine; I had to look up some artworks to be able to immerse myself in the settings of the book.\n\nAlthough there were some parts that disappointed me, I still liked the book and I finally understand why there are so much discussion and praises around this book. I recommend this to every Sci-fi fans for its importance and also, it\u2019s good to know where most fantastic Sci-Fi you\u2019ve read or you\u2019re reading now got its idea from. However, this is also where I\u2019ll stop with the series."}, {"label": "neutral", "text": "3.5/5\n\nHonestly, I never know exactly how to start my review after finishing a nearly nine hundred pages book, but I guess I'll start by saying that I definitely enjoyed it, but was it a life-changing reading experience? Unfortunately, not for me. This book is considered a classic of the science fiction genre, Frank Herbert did an amazing, or even one of a kind job, creating the entire universe in which Dune takes place, all the characters, descriptions and practically everything in this book was simply fascinating. I really wanted to be one of those people who closes this book and is completely in love with it, and then when someone asks if they've read it say \"Yeah, I love Dune, it's my favorite book.\" but as it turns out, I'm not that person. At least, yet. This is the first story in a six-volume series, so I hope that changes.\n\n\nLike I said, I liked it, but I genuinely think I would have loved it if I hadn't watched the movies. In my opinion, the movies are even a close-to-being-perfect adaptation of the Herbert\u2019s work and pretty much everything that happened in the book also happened in the first two films - with some small changes and a few scenes were in a different order, but it didn't change the fact that I still very much enjoyed watching both of them. Dune I and Dune II, being great adaptations, unfortunately meant that watching them before reading the book wasn't the best idea as I was bored for most of the story because I just knew what was going to happen. The first four hundred pages took me the longest to read because I watched Dune I twice, but thankfully it took me much less to finish the rest. The beginning (read the said first four hundred pages) were hard to read - which may not be much of an incentive for those planning to start I know - but the second half of the book even got me hooked. Frank's writing style may not have been entirely to my liking, the \"wow, what's happening\" moments didn't shock me as much as I thought they would, but the characters were amazing so I have to thank them because they are the reason for me being invested. Jessica was definitely my favorite here, followed by Paul, which I know is a boring answer, but what can I say, I liked them. They may even have become my favorite son and mother duo in books, which says a lot considering I've read a lot of stories in my life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally ending my rant, because I didn't plan to write so much, which is basically still nothing, because you could talk and talk without the end about this book, but I definitely plan to continuing this series. Maybe I'll even manage to finish all six books this year, we'll see. I hope at least.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nmaybe I'll be able to read all six books by the time the next movie comes out (2027?) we'll see (I'm already having trouble with all the names)"}, {"label": "positive", "text": "I have to write this review without rhythm so that it won\u2019t attract a worm.\n\nIn the distant future Arrakis is a hellhole desert planet where anyone who doesn\u2019t die of thirst will probably be eaten by one of the giant sandworms. It\u2019s also the only place where the precious spice melange can be found so it\u2019s incredibly valuable, and the honorable Duke Leto Atreides has been ordered by the Padishah Emperor to take over control of Arrakis from his mortal enemies, the House Harkonnen. While this seems like a great offer on the surface the Duke and his people realize that it\u2019s actually a cunning trap being set by the Emperor and Baron Harkonnen.\n\nThe only hope seems to be allying with the local populace called Fremen whose harsh environment has led them to become an incredibly tough and disciplined people, but they have their own vision of what Arrakis should be. They also have a prophecy about the coming of a messiah figure who will lead them to freedom, and the Duke\u2019s son Paul looks like he may be exactly who they\u2019ve been waiting for.\n\nThis is classic sci-fi that really deserves the label. What Frank Herbert accomplished in one novel is stunning because he built a fascinatingly detailed universe in which the politics, religion, economics, espionage, and military strategy are all equally important. He then blended these more grounded concepts with bigger sci-fi ideas like being able to use spice to see through space-time, and the scope of that encompasses trying to pick the proper path through various potential timelines as well as free will vs. fate.\n\nI think one of the factors that helps this story stay timeless is that so much of it is based on what humanity becomes vs. trying to predict what futuristic technology would be like. This is a society that once had a war with machines and has since rejected any type of computers so people have developed to fill the gap with the help of the spice. The Mentats are trained to use data to predict outcomes. The Navigators of the Guild have used so much of the spice to help them move through space that they\u2019re mutating. The all female Bene Gesserit have developed a variety of skills to place their members alongside positions of power to help advance their breeding scheme that spans generations. Herbert also cleverly came up with an excuse that explains why knives and hand-to-hand combat are so important with the idea of the personal body shields.\n\nSo even though we still got a good sci-fi\u2019s novel worth of cool gadgets the emphasis is on what the people can do and how that\u2019s developed over a long period of time. It also adds a lot of depth to the political dimensions because all of these groups have different agendas that cause them all to mistrust each other, but because they all fill these various roles none can exist without the others.\n\nThere are also parallels to our world that are still in play because the idea of a desert people caught up in the power struggles of various outsiders because of their valuable natural resource is an obvious allegory to the Middle East that still works today. Plus, the classic film came out a few years before Herbert published this, and you have to think that it had some influence on him because there are elements of the story that seem very much inspired by it.\n\nWhile the whole concept of a Chosen One has gotten a bit worn over time that\u2019s not Herbert\u2019s fault, and this is still a fantastic sci-fi story with big ideas that also works as space opera as well as being an epic adventure story."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "5 \u2b50\ufe0f\n2024 Re-read\n\nI have consumed the Water of Life and felt the spice agony.\nIt has revealed to me the error of my past ways.

part of the canon. This book was a bit of a mess with the characters, world, and plot all feeling a bit disjointed and half baked. The world, while interesting and obviously very detailed, is barely explained to the reader and relies heavily on the appendix without actually providing context in the story (with the exception of a few things like spice and the worms). These characters all felt a little flat and/or underutilized. The plot felt like two separate books, while being peppered with themes of glorifying colonialism, white saviors, and lack of agency for most of the women. Although I understand that is a product of when it was written, it still points to how there are much better works that have been written since even if they were influenced by this. I\u2019m interested to see what they do with the movie adaptation.

Dune sounds like a book that shouldn\u2019t work, but does, in an unique, complex and compelling manner.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last 25% of the book was a wild ride that really upped my enjoyment of this reread, and left me impressed with the worldbuilding and boldness of .\nBut to start: is a classic in the scifi field, but is quite atypical. Technological progress has stalled after a jihad against thinking machines (aka computers) and a kind of medieval society in space has emerged. An emperor reigns, planets are dished out as fiefs and mysterious sects () follow their own paths to influence events. Some kind of social darwinism is at play, and the conviction that humanity can be massively better (or worse) is we return our attention to oneself instead of towards technology.\n\nThe terms are at the start quite hard to get into, even though I know the story and remember some of them from last time reading the book. Arrakis, the Dune from the title, is an other interesting thing. This desert planet is almost a separate character (), being handed to the Atreides duke and worsening a blood feud with the Harkonnens, the previous owners of the planet.\n\nIt is interesting how Herbert decided to reveal the first murder plot perpetrator quite soon, showing evidently that this is a book more about ideas then tension.\nIn general the book is biblical in language and the weight assigned to events, with foreshadowing and myths. The world feels rich and alive.\n\nThe main character is Paul Atreides, the son of duke Leto. He is groomed to take on his role of leader of a major house, and by his Bene Gesserit mother Jessica (who is, for lack of a better analogy, a kind of crossing between a martial arts expert, nun and witch). There are several other retainers, who are depicted in a manner that I can only compare to .\nThe characters in general feel greater than life, for instance the level of perception and deduction at the dinner party is superhuman, I can only imagine because there is no advanced technology that the psychic training must somehow become more advanced and leads to the kind of casual analysis Jessica and Paul are capable of.\n\nThe fall of house Atreides is still a brutal event, even if you know it is coming and feels swift and unexpected, as does Paul\u2019s enlightenment.\n\n\n\n\nTo be fair, halfway in the book I felt a kind of lull in reading. The main characters are thrown back upon themselves and need to establish themself amongst the Freemen, Bedouin like desert folk who are much more powerful than thought.\nIn these sections there is such a sensitivity to culture and worldbuilding, Tatooine or the Aiel of are nothing compared to the depth Herbert manages to bring go Arrakis and its Freemen. So much must have been thought of but has been left out, given a richness in the world conjured that is only rivaled by Middle Earth.\n\nThe scenes are intense, and well written, but in way a bit dull since the ascent of Paul to power seems assured. There is banter that is really sharp, like:\n\n\nAnd Paul is shown as doubting, self aware of his rise and what it entails, commenting on heroism and mythmaking, and the restraints to his powers: ()\n\nBut the third part, especially to the end, shows real boldness by skipping two years and taking on tragic events (), sometimes only in an indirect manner.\nAlia is a good example, and all the implications and struggles, guilt, she must bring with her. You feel it, it is touched upon, but never in an on the nose manner.\nAnd the development of the relationship between Stilgar and Paul also carries sadness and an awareness of the corrosive power of adoration and myth:\n\nThe epicness of both the story and main character Paul (and a shoutout to Chani and Jessica as well) is just beyond anything.\nFor instance somewhere near the end Paul responds the following to a warning that the galactic emperor is coming down upon him in force:\n\n\n\nDecadence as an indication of ineffectiveness and decline, while orthodoxy, returning to the core of human struggle for life, is a way out of the impasse, comes back as a theme.\n\nThe actual enlightenment and power of Paul as gained by the spice is unknowable to a reader, since he operates on another level entirely. Time being a dimension, Paul transcends the three dimensions and becomes something inhuman along the way, a singularity like the technical singularity.\n\n\n\n\n\nOk\u00e9, what is this convenient weirding suddenly along the way?\nWhy is count Fenring there, what does he add in anyway to the story?\nAnd how the hell does Paul get nuclear weapons all of the sudden.\nAnd as said: the second part of the book really did not speak that much to me.\n\nBut in no way it can be denied that the world conjured by Dune is rich, bold and interesting, and that I very much look forward to see the movie in 2021!"}, {"label": "positive", "text": "As a teenager, \u2018Dune\u2019 blew my mind. I fell into the story and loved all the grandiose ideas. Over time, I reread the novel at least a half dozen times and read the follow-on novels. Looking back over time, I idolize it a bit less, recognizing some flaws, but it will always have a special place in my literary heart. For me, it's still one of the very best.\n\n\u201cA beginning is a very delicate time.\u201d\n\nFrom a literary standpoint, my favorite thing is how it throws us in the middle of a universe 20,000 years in the future and makes no attempt to explain the backstory. And there is an incredibly rich backstory. There is a spacefaring Old Empire, which became corrupt and fell. There was an AI Superintelligence that enslaved mankind, only to be overthrown, itself, leaving a universe where technology is used scarcely and carefully such as human computers knows as mentats. There is the founding of the Bene Gesserit religious cult, a collection of women whose goal is to manipulate mankind towards stability and enlightenment. None of this is clearly explained in the original novel, which really pushes the reader to deep curiosity and to make many inferences. It\u2019s this iceberg approach which gave me the most joy when reading it.\n\n\u201cFear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear.

Well, perhaps the biggest, which it shares with many epic western stories (Last of the Mohicans, The Last Samurai, Dances with Wolves, Avatar, etc.) is the \u2018white savior\u2019 trope. I think it\u2019s a valid criticism, but in Dune, Paul embraces the Fremen culture and does not try to change them or tell them how to live. This is addressed more deeply in the follow-on novels, as well. Another is treatment of women (largely - through the Bene Gesserit) as conniving and manipulative. In addition, women are used for marriage to develop alliances. Finally, one could make a case that the book explores eugenics, possibly the most problematic issue. It\u2019s not far off from the concerns in Star Wars with midichlorians and the Skywalker bloodline. I personally find it difficult to defend any type of eugenics as an ethical plot device.\n\n\u201cIrulan shall be my wife, opening the way for an Atreides to take the throne.\u201d\n\nHowever, on the positive side, the plot has some real strengths. It\u2019s clearly anti-colonialist and pro-environmentalist long before it was cool to be those things. It questions the powers of church and state and examines the implications of culture-clash. It examines how religion affects politics, and politics affect religion. Capitalistic greed is cast in a very ugly light. One might even call it anti-western thinking. There are strong female characters with intelligence and real power. And, through its backstory, it also examines the dangers of overreliance on technology.\n\n\u201cThe willow submits to the wind and prospers until one day it is many willows\u2014a wall against the wind.

The Fremen and their culture, the stillsuits, the worms, the plight for water... It's all explained in such a vivid detail without being boring or repetitive. And while reading you can see the references! Can we talk about how many movies and books have been influenced by this?\n\n\n\nWe also get a future Empire where machines are no longer used for computation purposes. Instead, humans have been trained to unlock their full brain potential and make such calculations. And we get two schools of these \"enhanced\" humans: the Bene Gesserit and the Mentats.

(I'm not spoiling anything by telling you this, believe me, the book will tell you ALL about it)\n\nThe story is told in a third person omniscient point of view, and the author uses this liberally, giving us a peek into the different characters' thoughts. And he loves repeating ideas. So we get to know about the betrayal from the bad guy who planned it, from the traitor himself, from everyone inside House Atreides who knows that there's a traitor and suspects everyone,... and all this before anything actually happens! When the scene finally rolls in I was so tired of the plot I almost gave up on the book.\n\nAfter this the plot actually picks up and there's lots of action. However I had some more problems with it, as I'll explain ahead.\n\nWhile they were all artfully created and developed;\n\nThe way Herbert planned his 'Chosen One' and his society, most of the characters are deeply logical and, dare I say, stuffy? They think and re-think, and plan and plot, and think again, computing everything with a very small dose of humanity. (Ha! And they call themselves humans.)\n\nPaul is wise beyond his years, not only by his training, but by his evolution during the story. It made me think of another chosen child: Harry Potter, but where we all wanted to be Harry, or at least one of his friends; I really had no thought of befriending this one. (I did pity him a lot.)\n\nAnd then there's the bad guy! Oh Gods. I've never in my life seen such a TERRIBLE antagonist and I don't say this lightly.\n\n\n\nHe's a fat ugly guy, who cannot even move himself. He's a pedophile, a slave worker, treats everyone horribly including his own family. There is absolutely no redeeming quality to this guy. He's almost cartoonish in how bad he is.\n\nAnd I never ever got his hate for the Atreides, I can understand greed, personal vendettas, house wars. But his hate seemed too personal and at the same time too huge to be understandable. Also, he was the typical movie villain that loved to rehash his plots over and over again, and brag about how cunning he was. Complete freaking waste of time.\n\nLast, but not least. and I DID NOT like it. Call me romantic, call me naive, call me soft. I don't care.

You already know it\u2019s fantastic though, right? Dune is one of those novels that is spoken of in reverential tones by seasoned reader and relative newbie alike. It\u2019s considered by many to be THE best sci-fi novel of all time and Herbert\u2019s son, Brian Herbert, rightfully calls it sci-fi\u2019s equivalent to Lord of the Rings for inspiring all that came after its publication.\n\nSo, I mean, what in the name of Shai-Hulud am I supposed to add to that?\n\nWell, I\u2019ll begin with the story of how I came to read . I\u2019m sure that there have been ample opportunities to read the book. I can remember seeing the black-spine amidst a forest of other spines on my cousin\u2019s bookshelf, of which I had free reign. Yet something always kept me from picking it up. It could have been my obsession with fantasy novels at that time with only the briefest allowances for sci-fi. Whatever the reason, the book continued to pop up. Its sliver of desert on a black background called to me from piles at used bookstores, the shelves of friends and relatives, and even on public transportation. All the same, I never got around to it.\n\nTwo factors finally made the difference. The first, my well-read friend (Josh Bragg in real life, but he\u2019s on Goodreads too!) always brought it up as one of the best books he\u2019s ever read. He also took the opportunity to remind me to read it whenever book recommendations went flying between us and, foolishly, I kept putting him off. But I\u2019m a sucker for a great looking book and these Penguin Galaxy sci-fi collections sealed the deal for me. Their elegant cover designs, the intros by Neil Gaiman, a selection of books I\u2019d always been meaning to read, AND was on it? I was absolutely delighted to find the book under the tree on Christmas morning and tore into it in earnest.\n\n\n\nThough it took near 200 pages to really pick up speed, the novel had me hooked from its immersive opening. Here was a world that was familiar and strange at the same time. There are elements of fantasy and religion coupled with interplanetary travel and space empires. The characters touted titles that were inscrutable at the beginning, but became part of my vocabulary before the novel\u2019s end. The novel refused to tell me everything I needed to understand, secreting mysteries without ever outright stating them. How could I not want to know what Kwisatz Haderach meant? How could I not want to know the secrets of Arrakis?\n\n\n\n\nI was swept away by this novel that mixes sci-fi concepts of higher dimensions with political intrigue. Environmental change mixed with an unlimited cast of enthralling characters, and a drop of religious philosophy. is a novel of the highest order: it combines entertainment with brilliant questions that pull from an incredible number of disciplines. Of course, if you just want to read a compelling tale of political plotting, murder, adventure, and discovery, you can totally do that too.\n\nIn the afterword, Brian Herbert notes a conversation he had with his father about the writing and structure of . Frank Herbert constructed so that it would be immensely dense. Herbert wanted to create a tale that could be enjoyed on the level of the central conflict: a boy becoming a man trying to reclaim his heritage against astounding odds in a world beyond imagining. Here\u2019s an excerpt from that afterword about the layers.\n\n\n\nThe fact that the novel can be enjoyed from any number of different readings alone makes it a novel of huge significance. doesn\u2019t force you into thinking, but it invites the interested to partake in its rich metaphor and multifaceted meaning. What\u2019s more, Herbert makes statements about his concepts, but rarely does he offer them as the only solution (barring, perhaps, an ecological viewpoint that bemoans industrialization). I dove into different fields of thought between and during readings. I contemplated elegant ideas Herbert proposes and marveled at the structure of the plot and the boundless ideas of this world.\n\nWhat a world it is! The world building here could fill a university course as Herbert establishes a world unlike any other, but totally believable. When I read about the stillsuit I was astonished by its creativity, but also how it imparted valuable information about the world of Arrakis. Though the sandworms scream for attention throughout the novel, equal care is given to the hierarchy of the Empire, the mystical Bene Gesserit religion, and the curiosities of culture. Herbert also seems to have invented a group of hallucinogenic compounds that are in equal parts trippy, interesting, and betray an interesting look at 1960s culture.\n\n\n\nOf course, when the ride does end, it is immensely satisfying. ends leaving unanswered questions in a fashion that made me feel like I knew enough to be entirely contented. Which, of course, begs the question: will I read the other novels?\n\nWelllllllllllllllll, maybe.\n\nIt\u2019s highly daunting to look at the entire and think that I would tackle that. Especially when ends in a way that makes me so happy, and especially when the subsequent novels purportedly deliver diminishing returns. For now, I\u2019m too overjoyed and impressed by to consider returning to the world anytime soon other than to re-read the novel.\n\nObviously, I can\u2019t recommend enough. That\u2019s also not a recommendation that goes to the sci-fi crowd alone. Oh no, this is a book that has great appeal to a wide variety of people. You like ? Perfect: you\u2019ll love the backstabbing, the plots-within-plots, the combat, the story. You don\u2019t read sci-fi? No worries: there\u2019s a wealth of important themes upon which to reflect.

Most authors, myself included, need more than one book in order to tell an epic coming-of-age story. Herbert did it in one while also creating a unique and interesting setting. Part of his genius as an author was his ability to imply far more about his world than he actually showed. As a result, Dune feels as if it was written by an inhabitant of Herbert\u2019s universe; no small achievement.\n\nAs with goes beyond the usual surface elements that so much of fiction relies upon. It deals with questions of leadership, ecology, and philosophy (and so much more) while also telling a darn good story.\n\nAnd it contains one of my favorite quotes:\n\n\u201c\nFear is the mind-killer.\nFear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.\nI will face my fear.\nI will permit it to pass over me and through me.\nAnd when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.\nWhere the fear has gone there will be nothing.\nOnly I will remain.\u201d\n\nThe book does have some flaws (the death of Muad\u2019Dib\u2019s son is dealt with too quickly, and the only homosexual character is the villain), but even with them, is a masterpiece."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "Like most of my five star books, I\u2019ve read Dune multiple times. In fact, I\u2019d say that what makes a book more than just enjoyable and instead truly amazing is that you want to read it more than once and are rewarded for doing so. I\u2019ve probably read Dune six times, and I\u2019ve never gotten tired of it but my understanding of the work has increased over time.\n\nTo begin with, the first time I read Dune, I got about three pages into it, realized I didn\u2019t understand a thing and that I was hopelessly confused. I had to go back and reread what I had read, and then go back again and reread the whole chapter. I would excuse myself by saying that I was 10, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one that has had that experience. Don\u2019t be dismayed if it happens to you - whether 10, 18, or 45. If you are confused at first, consider that Paul is also confused and finds so much that happens strange and new. Understanding will come in its proper time.\n\nAt one time at least, there was a fairly famous website (at least among geeks) that humorously summarized books in thirty words or less. Maybe it still exists, but its name escapes me. The summary provided for Dune read something like this, \u201cI\u2019m Frank Herbert and I\u2019m a lot smarter than you are.\u201d When I was younger, this would have seemed a fair appraisal of the work. One of the most central aspects of \u2018Dune\u2019 is Herbert manages to write convincingly about people whose intelligence is supposed to vastly exceed that of the reader. More than anything, to create a believable Messianic story, the writer has to create a Messiah possessing believable Messianic wisdom and insight, and Herbert succeeds at this invention probably better than any other writer. We come to believe that the protagonists do have deep and profound insight into the question of \u2018Life, the Universe, and Everything\u2019 so that we do not immediately feel cheated and we are able to believe in the characters \u2013 even someone like Maud\u2019Dib. As I\u2019ve gotten older, and hopefully wiser, I\u2019ve come to see that Herbert is not in fact possessed of superhuman intelligence, but that he creates the illusion of superhuman intelligence by a variety of clever devices. The appearance of a superhuman intelligence and wisdom is really a sham and the pool is really pretty shallow, but even this revelation does not reduce the esteem in which I hold the work. It\u2019s not Herbert\u2019s real job to be a prophet: he\u2019s an artist. Herbert succeeds brilliantly in what he should be judged on \u2013 the ability to paint the illusion deftly and convincingly. If we acquire the sophistication to see through it, it shouldn\u2019t reduce our appreciation of the artistic mastery used in creating it. I think now I would amend the summary of the work to be, \u201cI\u2019m Frank Herbert, and I\u2019m a lot better writer than you are.\u201d\n\nIf all that could be said in Dune\u2019s favor was that it had one of the most convincing invented prophets in literature, it would still be a worthwhile work. But Dune has abundant pleasures beyond the richly realized illusion of philosophical depth and even the deftly realized setting. Chief among these for me is the truly deep and intricate relationships Paul has with the other characters. There is a real depth of feeling here, and I love the way each of the complicated nuanced relationships is portrayed as we are introduced to the cast of Paul\u2019s complicated life. Each character feels a deep mixture of feelings for Paul who is boy, man, friend, soldier, sovereign, and Messiah and much else. There is tenderness to this work. We sense that complexity and tenderness right from the start, when his mother allows him to be tortured and to face murder, and then immediately thereafter experiences profound hope and joy: \u201cMy son lives.\u201d We feel Paul\u2019s boyish love for his friends and companions, who are also his father\u2019s henchmen and his teachers and who he is in turn their future Lord. We feel the more mature manly love that these companions have for their young charge and future ruler. Even Yueh loves the boy he must destroy. We feel the boyish admiration Paul has for his father as he strains to be worthy of him and to make his father proud, and we feel the returned pride and satisfaction that his father feels. We feel the aching love of a boy for this Mother when he has already lost everything else when Jessica is buried in sand, and we feel her returned love when she says, \u201cI knew you would find me.\u201d\n\nAnd though there love is only briefly on stage, still I find the love between Paul and Chani among the sweetest and most charming in literature. Who cannot thrill when scarcely knowing each other, but seeing their lives together stretching out before them both good and terrible, the young becoming but not yet lovers promise with tender vows nonetheless to be forever each other's comfort and joy and they feel their hitherto unseen future becoming a real solid now. Isn\u2019t that how it is in some way for all of us when we meet the one who will be the one and we suddenly realize we want to and we will spend the rest of our lives together regardless of what will happen? And how often have we felt the total unabashed joy as Paul does when we know our lover is now near?\n\n\u201cThat could only mean Chani was near by\u2014Chani, his soul, Chani his sihaya, sweet as the desert spring, Chani up from the palmaries of the deep south.\u201d\n\nAll that and \u2018Dune\u2019 is a wonderful exciting action adventure story filled with thrills and chases, fights and battles, and supersized edge of our imagination wonders. Worms.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that this is one of the best beloved books of all time. If you haven\u2019t read it, you should. If you have read it, read it again."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "I MEAN ... WHERE THE FUCK DO I REALLY EVEN START??? It's been a long time since I've been sucked into a FANTASY / SCI-FI world and didn't wanna leave it. Early examples of that happening include Potter, the Ink world and Lord of the Rings (first through the movies, and later the books).\n\nIn recent years, it has only happened with A Song of Ice and Fire and The Kingkiller Chronicles \u2013 two unfinished series ... a fate that DUNE, unfortunately, shares. [Can you hear me screaming all across the universe, Frank???]\n\nAnyways, I stopped reading fantasy and sci-fi for the simple reason that I was no longer excited by it. I read so much from these genres over my young adolescence (most notably fantasy ... sci-fi was never really my thing) that it felt right to \"move on\" at one point. I never regretted it, and rarely look back.\n\nBUT when I saw in theatres, I felt a like an excitable kid again. That movie had me hooked. From the first minute on, I knew I would be going on one hell of a ride. I saw the film with my best friend and we both couldn't believe what we had just witnessed. Cinema history akin to (or at least that's how I imagine the people who got out of the cinema back in the early 2000s). This is a FRANCHISE that one can work with. This is something that will stick with us for the next couple of years, especially if they make TWO more movies (instead of just one).\n\ndidn't have that typical sci-fi feel (...my only reference point is tho, lmao). It felt much more like set in space. What drives forward is not its setting and all of the space travel, it's the political intrigue.\nWhen Duke Leto Atreides gets the order from the Padisha Emperor Saddam IV to replace his cousin, the Baron Harkonnen, as ruler of the planet Arrakis (also known as DUNE), he knows that that's not a gift. The Emperor is intimidated by Leto's power and that he's held in high esteem by the other Higher Houses of the universe. And therefore Leto (along with the other Atreides) must be stopped. What then ensues is an exhilarating and complex net of plots which focuses on the all encompassing question of power. What makes a good ruler? Who is \"allowed\" to rule? What about the people who are ruled?\n\nI didn't expect to be as psychological and philosophical as it was ... even though I heard it gets even more META throughout the rest of the series (CAN'T WAIT!). At the heart of the story, we follow Paul Atreides, son of Duke Leto, as he moves with his parents and their entourage from Caladan to Arrakis.\n\n\n\n\nPaul was trained throughout his young life (he is 15 at the beginning of the book) by his mother, Lady Jessica, in her Bene Gesserit ways. The Bene Gesserit are a pseudo-religious organization of all-women spies, nuns, scientists, and theologians who use genetic experimentation, galactic political interference, and religious engineering to further their own agenda of ascending the human race with the advent of their chosen one, the Kwisatz Haderach. Paul struggles with the burden his mother has chosen for him. He knows that there is no such thing as \"the chosen one\"; it's a farce, a manipulation \u2013 and yet something he can't escape.\n\nNot gonna lie, I had my problems with Herbert's writing throughout the first third of the book. I have never read something quite like it. I know lots of people had problems with the rich world building in because Herbert tends to throw hundreds of terms (unique to his world) around without any explanation for them in the text; but having seen the movie BEFOREHAND (something I would highly recommend) made it SUPER EASY for me to picture everything and follow along. No, the problem I had was the actual WRITING STYLE. At first, it felt really clunky and ... just weird? Like, not literary at all? I know I'm doing a piss poor job at explaining it but at first I felt like I was reading a weird fanfiction of the movie (LMAO).\n\nBut when I got used to the writing and accepted it for what it is, I got reeeeaally lost in the book. And was actually amazed at how MODERN??? the writing felt. Like, could've literally been written in the 21st century. The writing definitely didn't feel OLD, even though it felt WEIRD in some parts. :D\n\nAnyways, I finished within three days (which is a feat for me ... the book is almost 700 pages long and I usually only read 50 pages a day). It was a true page turner, especially two-thirds into the book \u2013 when we finally got to the part of the story that wasn't shown in the movie \u2013 I was glued to the pages. I couldn't believe what was happening. All the twists and turns were just AMAZING. And the ending was puurrrfect. [I really like that can be read as a standalone ... especially since I don't feel like committing to a 6-book-series that isn't even finished and literally 20+ extra novels that Herbert's son wrote to broaden the universe.]\n\nis not a book I'd recommend to just anyone. You must have an appetite for it. You must be willing to forgive its author a couple of things for full enjoyment (like the role of women in the story, and that there are very few female characters to begin with; or Herbert's homophobia which comes through in his portrayal of the Baron Harkonnen).

But if you really WANT to go on this journey, then will hold many adventures and purse-clutching moments for you.\n\n: THE LITANY OF FEAR"}, {"label": "neutral", "text": "Epic and highly inventive, but not nearly as great as I remember it being. I think Herbert's writing really gets in the way of the story. He continuously tells the reader what each character is thinking through italicized internal dialogue. Sometimes uses the third person narration to do the same thing in a more elegant way. The problem is that he does both, often times for the same character in the same paragraph. It's super clunky, and took me out of the story every time."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "\"No tendr\u00e9 miedo. El miedo mata la mente.

Abri\u00e9ndome as\u00ed las puertas a un g\u00e9nero que ha conseguido toda mi atenci\u00f3n. Un viaje sin duda apasionante. Me ha hecho sentir como un ni\u00f1o abriendo un regalo y descubriendo un nuevo camino como lector en la CF. Consigue lo que todo libro y autor puede aspirar, ser memorable en el tiempo y en la memoria del lector que lo disfrut\u00f3. No puedo ponerle menos de cinco estrellas a esta joya.\n\nLa importancia de Dune creo que a d\u00eda de hoy es indiscutible. Se considera como el que sent\u00f3 las bases de la ciencia ficci\u00f3n moderna. Lo que Frank Herbert logr\u00f3 en su libro es sorprendente porque logr\u00f3 construir un mundo fascinante con una ambientaci\u00f3n muy detallada que logra sumergirte en el propio desierto de Arrakis. Pero es que no solo esto ya que la pol\u00edtica, la econom\u00eda, las luchas de poder, la religi\u00f3n, la ecolog\u00eda, la supervivencia y las estrategias logra que no solo sean importantes en la trama sino que sean incorporados de manera muy eficiente a la historia. P\u00e1gina tras p\u00e1gina me fue demostrando la pasi\u00f3n que le puso a su obra y el derroche de imaginaci\u00f3n e ideas que ten\u00eda en su mente. El libro se public\u00f3 en 1965 y fue rechazado previamente por muchas editoriales. Las cu\u00e1les en ese momento y hoy, se deben arrepentir mucho xD.\n\n\n\nTenemos una historia atemporal que trata sobre en lo que se ha convertido y como vive el ser humano. Seguimos a unos personajes muy interesantes que cumplen diversos roles o en algunos casos, destinos. Tenemos un mont\u00f3n de intrigas, sociedades de estrategia ya sea militar, pol\u00edtica o religiosa pero sobretodo trata sobre la supervivencia en el planeta, Arrakis. Donde la riqueza, la verdadera riqueza, se cuenta en la cantidad de agua que uno posee. Una historia sobre lo que conlleva crear un profeta. Una sociedad muy compleja y complicada en la que la tecnolog\u00eda es algo importante, en algunos casos esencial para la vida. Un mundo muy detallado que se ve diferente pero al mismo tiempo similar al nuestro. Consigue que vivas lo que est\u00e1n pasando los personajes y sus pensamientos. Su brillante ambientaci\u00f3n con todos sus paisajes se sienten con total vividez, es un deleite absoluto para la vista o mejor dicho como lectores, para la imaginaci\u00f3n. Consigue transportarte al desierto y las dunas de Arrakis.\n\nPara mi este es el mayor logro del libro por parte de su autor, pasar las p\u00e1ginas y sentir que est\u00e1s ah\u00ed, imaginar todo lo que te rodea cada grano de arena, cada roca, los gusanos y lo que supone vivir ah\u00ed. La constante importancia que se le da al agua en las p\u00e1ginas, tu propia mente la refleja d\u00e1ndote y a mi me pas\u00f3, sed.\n\n\n\nEl planeta Arrakis me fascin\u00f3. Sus desiertos, sus dunas y sus gusanos. Un mundo que curiosamente a pesar de generar la substancia m\u00e1s preciada del universo su bien m\u00e1s preciado es el agua. Que se lo digan a sus habitantes, los indomables Fremen. Una sociedad cuya forma de vida los ha endurecido con curiosas pero l\u00f3gicas costumbres que se basan en la adoraci\u00f3n de un bien que escasea y es fundamental para la supervivencia, es su moneda, el agua. Un bien muy preciado, el agua es vida y aqu\u00ed todavia mas debido a la escasez y la valoran por encima de todo.\n\nEsto forma los pilares en los que componen a su sociedad por ejemplo; si lloraras a un muerto o escupes es considerado una se\u00f1al de gran respeto para ellos, ya que significa perder agua corporal.\n\nEn Arrakis se utilizan destiltrajes, una compleja y brillante vestimenta que absorve cada gota de agua que sale del cuerpo y la convierte en agua potable para que el portador del destiltraje pueda volver a beberla. Uno podr\u00eda decir asqueroso. Pero si vives en Arrakis lo necesitar\u00e1s y agradecer\u00e1s desesperadamente beber.\n\n\n\nTenemos un repertorio de personajes que muestran cierta profundidad. Complejos, bien construidos y perfilados. Pero sobretodo muy humanos, pues se mueven por el poder, la religi\u00f3n y sobretodo por la supervivencia. Lo que m\u00e1s flojea para mi son los personajes secundarios. Si bien es cierto que no tienen el mismo peso que los principales s\u00ed los he notado m\u00e1s de adorno, les falta mostrar algo de complejidad y atracci\u00f3n al leer.\n\nPrincipales como los que componen la casa Atreides, aquellos que luchan por ellos con lealtad hac\u00eda su duque y algunos de los ind\u00f3mitos Fremen. Tenemos villanos, como principal yo dir\u00eda el Bar\u00f3n Harkonen, enemigo de la casa Atreides y un maestro de las intrigas, consigue lo que se propone sin que nada se interponga y es un ser bastante despreciable.\n\nCon estos personajes obtenemos unos di\u00e1logos trabajados, cargados de grandes citas. Citas dignas de marcar.\n\nTenemos profec\u00edas, peleas, armas, sociedades, gusanos de arena y tecnolog\u00eda que a\u00fan no siendo un lector experimentado en el g\u00e9nero, yo creo que quiz\u00e1s no conste de tantos elementos tecnol\u00f3gicos o t\u00e9rminos como en otras obras de CF ya que me pareci\u00f3 m\u00e1s una mezcla de espada/fantas\u00eda/CF. Hay momentos con cierta epicidad, cargados de emoci\u00f3n, momentazos que consiguen representar la esencia de lo que es Dune y como lector me he quedado sorprendido. En la historia hay humanos con ciertas habilidades especiales.\n\nAunque yo dir\u00eda que la inteligencia en especial con las estrategias es la mayor o la m\u00e1s importante habilidad/arma que se da en el libro. Los personajes le aportan mucho a la trama y encajan en ella a la perfecci\u00f3n, captan el inter\u00e9s del lector queriendo o incluso necesitando pasar las p\u00e1ginas para saber lo que pasar\u00e1 a continuaci\u00f3n, las estrategias y decisiones que ejecutar\u00e1n y el desenlace.\n\n\n\nComo punto negativo para mi ha sido el final. Me dio la sensaci\u00f3n de que se precipitaba un poco, me hubiera gustado que tuviera m\u00e1s p\u00e1ginas porque algunos momentos del desenlace me parecieron un poco bruscos, pasan muchas cosas en el \u00faltimo momento. El desenlace es casi ambiguo, un medio abierto medio cerrado. Se dan respuestas y puedes quedarte ah\u00ed y no continuar, pero tambi\u00e9n queda alg\u00fan interrogante. A\u00f1adir que al inicio de cada cap\u00edtulo hay peque\u00f1os fragmentos que quiz\u00e1s se comprendan mejor con una segunda lectura.\n\nDune es una joya que perdurar\u00e1 en el tiempo y en la mente de los lectores que lo hemos disfrutado. Ha marcado mi inicio en la CF y ahora contemplo con gratitud y una gran emoci\u00f3n lo que me espera en este g\u00e9nero.

With a new version and including some serious firepower from Director Denis Villeneuve to Timothee Chalamet as Muad'dib the Kwisatz Haderach, it seemed like a good moment for a rewatch. It truly is a gorgeous film, but not so hot on the woke front. Surprise surprise surprise says my brain in its full Gomer Pyle mode.\n2/15/17: I found this 2003 about the 1984 film on YouTube. I wasn't wrong. The film wasn't very good. Beautiful, yes; good, not so much.\n***\nI first read this novel in 1975. It seems impossible that it was over 40 years ago, but the math is inescapable and time inexorable. My teenaged brain was rewired by the read. I had a standard by which to judge all future SFnal reads, and it was a high one. I was transported into a future I was utterly convinced would be the the one I'd have descendants to live in. I suppose that could yet happen. I'm a lot less convinced now that the human race's future is that long. Age might bring wisdom, I wouldn't know about that, but it sure brought me a booster shot of cynicism.\n\nThe Orange Catholic Bible, the books of the Empress Irulan, they all seemed to me so real...the cry \"never to forgive, never to forget\" rings louder today than it did in 1975 because I've lived through so many iterations of it by now. Us people, we love the shit out of our vicious vengeful vendettas, don't we. Frank Herbert got that right as all hell.\n\nTrouble is, ol' Frank wasn't any kind of a writer, was he? He had flashes of good phrasemaking, he had long stretches of competent prosemongering, and then there was the rest of the ninety jillion words in the novel. Serviceable is le mot juste. And TBH I feel pretty generous putting it that way.\n\nBut then came David Lynch. Oh dear, oh dear. I'm not a worshipper of Lynch's at the best of times. I thought was brummagem and boring; was portentous twaddle. So the Kool-Aid passed my seat, I fear. His 1984 adaptation of was downright laughable. I left the theater torn between gales of laughter and gusts of grief-stricken tears. Sting in that stupid winged underwear! KYLE MacLACHLAN as Paul Atreides!! Ludicrous, all of it, and the problems started with the butchery of so much of the novel that even the bones were scattered in no sensible pattern. Inevitable, really, as the runtime of the film was a paltry two hours and seventeen minutes. Imagine trying to wedge a 600-page magnum opus dense with world-building and replete with internal ironies and levels of meaning into the length of a good winter's nap. Didn't work so good.\n\nSciFi Channel, gods please bless their collective hides, approved a mini-series written and directed by John Harrison in 2000. It was 4:17:07 in total. That was *almost* enough to do justice to the story. The result was infinitely superior to the Lynch version. It was a joy to watch for me, a forty-year-old cruelly wounded mess of a man, and felt like a balm to my fanboy memory of the novel. Perfect? No. Great? Yep!\n\nThen I found it on YouTube (of course it's since been deleted) and thought I'd take a respite from reality by giving it a rewatch.\n\nYou know what? Special effects age badly. Mid-budget TV ones age really, really, really badly. The screenplay clunked a good deal. The story, however, was all there and was well done, with the prunings and bonsai sculptings well chosen and well shaped. And the story was just about as timely as anything I could've hoped to avoid!\n\nbashed me upside the temples with its portrayal of the collapse of Empire and revolution of the have-nots in a way it couldn't have 17 or 42 years ago. It felt more timely, it packed more wallop than it possibly could have in fatter times. This is my idea of good myth-making: A story that isn't finished telling us the truth yet, and doing so in a way that compels, impels, propels us to go on the journey ready or not. The idea of a Savior come to rescue us is eternally appealing, the sight of the unworthy getting their comeuppance is evergreen. It wasn't what I was seeking, wasn't escapist boom-bang-blowwie, but it was what I needed. A bit of heartening to fight again, odds be buggered.\n\nAnd now I'm told that , possibly to be directed by Denis Villeneuve of fame. That's some fire-power there. A director with clout and access to Hollywood's cash box could do something special with this epic...though I'm still very concerned with the issues inevitable in adapting the story to movie length.\n\nIsn't it interesting how every decade seems to call for a new version of the story? The 1960s had the novel; the 1970s the unmade adaptation, a perfect reflection of the decade's malaise/limitation mentality; the 1980s cheesy, overblown one-note-and-it's-the-wrong-one ethos; the 1990s void, again perfectly in keeping with the culture; the 2000s TV version, as everything shrunk in the aftermath of the floodwaters of Bush's election stealing; and now a big-budget, major-talent remake! That hasn't happened yet! And bids fair not to, in the parlous economic times ahead!\n\nFrank Herbert's is a great rewatch. The novel hasn't finished with us yet.

The book's prestige among genre fans was a factor, as were admissions by many that they read it in junior high school and found Herbert accessible.

I could almost smell the incense burning.\n\n\n\nThe galactic intrigue begins in the year 10,191 with excerpts from writings by the Princess Irulan, daughter of the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV and a holder of literary pretensions. The princess offers some perspective at the beginning of each chapter, hipping the reader to what's happening behind the scenes. We're introduced to Paul Atreides, the 15-year-old heir of Duke Leto Atredies, a charismatic planetary governor of Caladan whose popularity among the noble houses of the universe has garnered the attention, and jealously, of the emperor. Setting a trap, he offers Leto the planet of Arrakis, the most valuable real estate in the universe.\n\nArrakis is inhospitable to all but titanic-sized sandworms and a fierce tribe of desert dwellers known as the Fremen, but produces the priceless spice melange. In a future where mankind no longer relies on computers, the spice is a transformative agent that expands consciousness: empowering the navigators of the Spacing Guild who travel through space, the savvy Mentats who advise heads of state and the bewitching Reverend Mothers of the Bene Gesserit sect who see the future. Leaving their ancestral home on the verdant Caladan for Arrakis with Paul is his mother, the Lady Jessica, the duke's concubine and a Bene Gesserit, who is a black sheep among the Reverend Mothers.\n\nplace-between, -- FROM \"MUAD'DIB, FAMILY COMMENTARIES\" BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\n\nOn moving day, Paul is visited by the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, Jessica's teacher, for a rite of passage and a test. The old crone confronts Jessica, who defied the Bene Gesserit order that she bear a daughter the sect intended to marry off to Feyd-Rautha, heir to the House Harkonnen, the industrious enemies of House Atredies. The Bene Gesserit believed the progeny of such a pairing would have produced the Kwisatz Haderach, a male with the power to see through space and time as they do. Jessica opted to bear Duke Leto the boy he wanted instead. The Reverend Mother sees some potential in Paul, but offers no hope his father will live to an old age.\n\nPaul's education is overseen by his father's advisors--Thufir Hawat (a Mentat), the troubadour-warrior Gurney Halleck, the swordmaster Duncan Idaho and Dr. Wellington Yueh--but mostly by the Lady Jessica, who has trained her son in Bene Gesserit meditative techniques. Arriving in the garrison town of Arrakeen, Jessica encounters a housekeeper named the Shadout Mapes who is full of Fremen superstitions, intrigued as to whether Jessica may be the One, mother to the messiah who their prophecy holds will lead their people out of slavery. After Paul saves the housekeeper's life from a Harkonnen booby trap intended for him, she confides to the boy that there is a traitor among them.\n\nDuke Leto forges an alliance with the Fremen, using imperial planetolgist Liet Kynes--who's gone native on Arrakis--as a liaison. Operating with the blessing of the Emperor and the assistance of his Sardaukur troops, the gluttonous Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and his Mentat, Piter De Vries, attack Arrakeen after the traitor in the House Atredies lowers the garrison's shields for them. The Baron exiles the Lady Jessica and Paul so he can claim plausible deniability in their deaths, but mother and son find refuge with the Fremen, with the tribe's revered leader Stilgar and Kynes' daughter, Chani. Paul learns of the prophecy of Muad'Dib, the desert mouse, who the Fremen hold as their messiah.\n\n-- FROM \"ARRAKIS AWAKENING\" BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN\n\nheld me for over 616 of the paperback's 794 pages (appendixes, a map and an afterword by Brian Hebert stretch this edition to 883 pages) and in spite of its headlong dive into anticlimax, distilling the novel's pleasures have reminded me of what a fantastic trip it is. What separates from the work of most of Herbert's peers is the finesse of its prose and the depth of its characters as well as its ideas, which in a novel of this size, are plenty. Rather than write a novel in six sleepless nights as many before and since have done in this genre, Herbert took six years to research and write his science fiction, and the quality control shows.\n\nNames like \"Beast\" Rabban or Count Hasimir Fenrig materialized to form clear images of Herbert's characters in my mind, and I liked how each of them--whether noble, assassin or servant--served their institutions and played their part in this galactic intrigue to their end. No one in remains static; there is work to be done or movement to be had at all times. The novel is like a chess game and the faster it plunged toward its climax, these characters did begin to resemble game tokens instead of humans. Herbert also writes entrances much better than he does exits--a symptom of book one in a series, perhaps--but envisions a wealth of roles for women in his universe.\n\nis science fiction and if you're in the market for having your imagination stretched, you came to the right place. I found Herbert's ideas to be vastly compelling, many of them explored in detail and at length with fluid prose, as if the author were an anthropologist reporting back on a real universe: A future where expanded consciousness is more powerful than any machine. A matriarchal religious sect steering the genetic future of mankind. A consciousness expanding spice exploited as a commodity.

It is a very complex novel with a lot of things going, characters with many motivations, and many warnings about hero worship and the way the environment has influence on people. Let's go ahead and focus on the elephant(s) in the room: the dialogue, the portrayal of women, and the colonialism thing.\n\nThe dialogue isn't as terrible as I thought it would be. Yes, there are some characters with weird dialogue like Piter, the Baron, Thufir Hawat, and Gurney Halleck. Everyone else was mostly fine; Lady Jessica was kind of a middle ground. The dialogue flowed a bit strange at times and the characters' mental reactions to certain statements often sounded like a computer talking. But other than that, fine.\n\nThe women of . Those who have not read are probably unaware that the story is partially narrated, or at least partially described, by Princess Irulan the daughter of the emperor and a Bene Gesserit. Irulan's excerpts reveal her omniscience, but also reveal how she knew Paul was not the hero everyone initially thought him to be. Lady Jessica I felt very conflicted about. She certainly could outsmart several people, especially men, as a result of her Bene Gesserit training. However, at times Lady Jessica seemed like the stereotypical overemotional motherly figure that has been featured in many stories, not just sci-fi. Jessica and Gurney have a debate on being emotional versus being very logical; an argument that readers will soon learn is not just on page. It feels kind of essentialist to make Jessica the emotional one and Gurney the logical one, that whole \"women are emotional and men are logical\" thing. At one point Jessica is so emotional that she fails to see that Dr. Yueh is the traitor just as he's about to tell her. On the other hand, Gurney gets so logical he fails to see how emotions play into humans' actions and decision. I don't think Jessica is the worst depiction, because she is very strong and smart, but still it feels stereotypical.\n\nAnd Chani, Paul's Fremen lover. To be honest, Chani was just kind of there. She was certainly strong given her Fremen upbringing, but her impact on the story was not as much as I had been led to believe. She is certainly a motivational factor for Paul, but beyond that not much else.\n\nAlia was probably the best female character. Innocent yet calculating in her thoughts and actions. I am so glad that Frank Herbert didn't kill her off in the final cut, though I wish we could see more of her.\n\nThe Bene Gesserit are an order of psychic witch-geneticist-nun-things who have trained many of the women in the empire. They have a breeding program to create the perfect male version, the Kwisatz Haderach--whom they believe Paul to be, or at least fit the myth of the Kwisatz Haderach into Paul--, and thus have become concubines for various male rulers, like Lady Jessica, in the empire to secure and purify the line. The Bene Gesserit are responsible for many things and events within , including the desiring of the spice drug and initially planting the religion among the Fremen to control them. An all-female organization with malefic intentions was not too common back when Herbert wrote this book. The Bene Gesserit are not the primal antagonists of ; interestingly enough, that right goes to power-hungry and corrupted men like the Baron and his nephews and the emperor. However, the fact that the Bene Gesserit are responsible for some many things and are all women makes me question the reasons. At no point in the story are women outright described as being inherently villainous, but why the Bene Gesserit like that? Who knows?\n\nAs for the colonialism aspects of the story, is actually pretty self-aware of this at times. It's clear that the empire and the Baron do not treat either the Fremen nor the planet well and the Fremen have every right to hate them. The book does not shy away from the Bene Gesserit's religious manipulation of the Fremen, even. One of the most important scenes in the book is Liet-Kynes' death. Before he dies, Liet-Kynes has a hallucination of his father who warns him that his support for turning Paul into a hero is one of the worse things he could've done for the Fremen and that Arrakis' environment influences people way more than they expect. A hero from the colonizers/settlers/offworlders--whatever you want to call them--cannot be a true hero for the natives of the planet, he will only doom them. However, also at times enacts the \"noble savage\" archetype. The Fremen are strong and courageous, but are ultimately wildlings with a regressive and superstitious society. So close, yet so far.\n\nOkay, anyway, an actual review.\n\nis actually one of the most poignant descents into villainy--tyranny?--I have ever read. The whole book is a warning about hero worship. Paul Atreides goes from being an inexperienced duke's son to Usul Muad'Dib, the messianic figure of the Fremen religion. According to his mother, he actually wasn't supposed to embody the religious aspects of the hero, and yet he does. Paul is literally a contradiction to every single other character's ideals and goals. He shows how logic and emotion and coexist in someone (Jessica and Gurney), how eliminating those you have deemed as failed is actually weakening yourself (the Baron), and how the religious superstitions you plant might have truth (Jessica and the Bene Gesserit), and how status of birth and breeding guarantees no certainty (again the Bene Gesserit).\n\nBack to the environment thing. Arrakis' rigid environment has influenced everyone and everything who has touched it. The necessity of the spice, the prominence and strength of the Fremen religion, the political arrangements--everything! This went hand in hand with Paul's rise to power. The emperor and the Baron thought they knew or could control Arrakis and cause the downfall of Atreides, but instead their misunderstanding and pride only caused the birth of a (anti-)hero. Arrakis will deal with Paul later, I'm sure. But on its own.\n\nPaul's rise was subversive. I went from expecting to fearful in such a subtle and gradual way. isn't perfect.

I met people like the warmaster Gurney Halleck and the swordmaster Duncan Idaho, the aging assassin Thufir Hawat, the wise and powerful Lady Jessica of the Bene Gesserit, the disgustingly evil Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, and the stunningly beautiful Princess Irulan. I encountered the greatest of the sandworms in the deep desert, and I witnessed Muad\u2019Dib as he lived amongst the mysterious blue-eyed Fremen and as he struggled and fought against those who betrayed his family.\n\nNow, ten years later, I have read the book once more. And to my great satisfaction I discovered that it had lost none of the magic that worked so well on me the first time. The political machinations of the Great Houses and the Imperium were still as interesting and exciting as the first time. The sandworms were still as awe-inspiring as when I last read about them. And even though the book could not possibly have the same effect on me today as it had on that little boy ten years ago, it was still an amazingly enjoyable book from the first page until the very end. There was more than a fair bit of nostalgia involved when it came to settling on a final rating, and I find it likely that the rating would have been lower if I were reading this for the first time.

It's about the seizure of native lands and the dispossession it causes. In the first book the protagonist Paul Atreides 'goes native' and joins the indigenous fremen in their revolt against the galactic empire after his family is betrayed. He takes a fremen name, learns their culture, takes a fremen 'concubine' and turns into a messiah figure (this is where the debate about white saviorism plays in.) Herbert himself was very sympathetic towards indigenous communities and rallied for their causes, but he was also a libertarian, far-right political writer. Immerwahr tries to show that this unresolved conflict between Herbert's two opposing political commitments shows up in the power dynamics and political differentials within the series. And I must say, I agree.\n\n'Spice' has been interpreted as a psychedelic drug and there are clear middle-Eastern influences in the writing of fremen culture (although Herbert had a very surface understanding of middle-Eastern culture and politics, and never went deep into it.) The far-right on the other hand, has been very intolerant of drugs, the middle East, climate change, ecological preservation and indigenous populations. This difference in Herbert's ideologies is so clearly discernible in Paul's shifting roles between hero and villain.\n\nThe book is also about counter culture and interestingly, we have seen a rise of right wing counter culture recently and a renewed interest in the Dune series.

Frank Herberts set up an amazing and complex political universe and sets it to explode, sending us off on a trajectory picked up by Dune Messiah. Set 12 years after the events of Dune, we find Paul Maud\u2019dib on the Emperors throne and the Jihad has \u2018killed sixty-one billion, sterilised ninety planets, completely demoralised five hundred others\u2019 all in Paul\u2019s name. has vastly expanded mechanics yet resides in a much smaller scale than its predecessor, being almost a parlor drama of \u2018\u2019 as before but with a more focused proximity to really feel the tension creaking through the narrative. Expanding on themes of the ways religion and politics are manipulated for power and diving deep into ideas of fate and freedom with a touch of along the way, is a tense and psychological thriller that really drives home the ideas left open at the end of the previous novel and charts a course for incredible new directions for the larger narrative.\n\nWhile the original plays out on epic proportions, feels more like a Greek tragedy. Withing a few chapters of the opening we see the plot drop into the chamber and be fired off with a pretty clear indication what it leads, yet every step of the way still feels fresh and thrilling. This is in keeping with the story as well, seeing as Paul foresees much of what is coming but after a decade of winning and no surprises, a psychological challenge that could be unexpected is what he craves. \u2018\u2019 Herbert writes, and Paul, feeling isolated from even those he loves due to his prescience while increasingly speaking with Alia on their shared struggle, begins to wish for a way to escape his all-knowing fate. This becomes increasingly tragic when he can see great loss before they happen and the only advice his sister can give is \u2018\u2019\n\nThe story feels a bit more loose and less tidy in this one, an obvious difficulty when constructing a narrative around prescience. Yet the political tensions and plottings keep it sharp and direct, and where Herbert really excels is getting into character\u2019s heads during discussions and seeing the internal mastermining going on. This is especially exciting with Scytale, a Tleilaxu Face Dancer that can shift into any body because if Bene Gesserits weren\u2019t enough, this shapeshifting class only hinted at before is now on full conniving display to remind you that the Dune universe is terrifying and awesome. It is a tight cast, with less than a dozen primary characters including the return of Duncan Idaho as a clone, or \u2018ghola\u2019, also going by the name Heyt. Which, as expected, becomes an issue with the Fremen who see technology such as this as potentially blasphemous. Scytale warns \u2018\u2019 and much of is mental chess full of strong emotions to throw Paul off his game. It\u2019s pretty dark, considering he knows Duncan has been sent to probably kill him and it\u2019s his friend yet not his friend at all as boisterous Duncan is now a stoic and pensive intellectual.\n\n\u2018\u2019\n-Ancient Fremen Saying\n\nseems hellbent on reminding you that the events of Dune were not a heroic and great thing but a pretty twisted political contest of colonialism, manipulation and mass murder. Like murder on the galactic scale of genocide. The Jihad is not awesome and people are starting to talk about that. The opening pages are an intense interview with a historian about to be executed for writing a critical historical analysis of Paul and his rise to power, and he tells the Fremen \u2018\u2019 The ruling powers dismiss anything not in keeping with their narrative, one held firmly together by the glue of religion. \u2018\u2019 Herbert writes, and asks us \u2018\u2019 We begin to see the religious gaslighting to keep a strong and obedient population ready to kill. \u2018\u2019\n\nWhat seems most dangerous is the knowledge of what is to come and the lack of freedom to escape fate. This novel delves deeper into ideas of memory as well as looking to the future with characters like Alia that have memory accessible in her cells to converse with the ancestral past. It becomes very existential, with question if there is any agency to truly make choices, locked into political decisions as well as the awareness of the future. Paul is set up much like the Nietzschean yet in this novel he rejects it and wishes to escape it. \u2018\u2019 he says, which also feels a nod to Nietzche\u2019s concept of . What unfolds is brilliant and becomes an excellent example of refusing the body for the myth. While the end is sad and tragic, it is also a cementing of immortality as the eternal Maud\u2019dib, now more legend and legacy than ever before.\n\nis a shorter sequel that packs a lot of power on the smaller scale while managing to make the universe vastly larger and more complex. There is much distrust stirred in this book, with distrust in rulers, history and religion being a major purpose for Herbert. In an essay by his son, , he mentions how his father saw the Watergate scandal as a positive: \u2018\u2019 This message of questioning leaders, especially ones who impose moral codes through religion and seek to dismiss critical historical perspectives as execution-worthy heresy is at heart in . Legacy and fate are critical themes, as well as breeding schemes that will determine the future ruler of Arakkis.

Ok, I will try to write this without puking. In this book Alia is 15, going on 16 and apparently on heat. At some point, the author makes her fight naked and when Paul sees her, he realizes that she became a woman and almost gets a hard-on. Grose. And then there is talk about finding her a mate, later she feels a \u201cpost-coital sadness\u201d and so on. Oh, and Duncan kisses her.

And I didn't really care about Duncan Idaho, anyway, since he was only in Dune for like forty pages and he only spoke about twice. Telling me ten times in a row that Paul really really liked Idaho is not going to make me feel the same way about him, Frank Herbert!\nNow I'm afraid to read number three."}, {"label": "neutral", "text": "It's difficult for me to be too tough on this book because it simply feels incomplete. About half the size of the original, it feels like a simply bridge to Children of Dune than an actual sequel to Dune. But the theme of the story is one that Frank Herbert must have believed personally and that is Think For Yourself. People are not gods. Gods are not governance. To deify politicians and world leaders is a can of worms that should never be opened.\n\nFans of the original fell in love with Paul Atreides and to see him essentially as a flawed leader with clay feet left a bitter taste in many mouths. So, again, it's easy to understand the criticism. It's like if Empire Strikes Back came out and Luke turned out to be just some dude who was more lucky than gifted. I\u2019ll always recommend reading Messiah and Children of Dune together. Because as a stand alone, Messiah vanishes under the vast shadow cast by its predecessor."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "Having re-read Dune (and reviewed it here on GR) recently, I figured I should continue and read at least the initial trilogy with Dune Messiah and Children of Dune to get a better idea of the world that Frank Herbert created. I am glad that I read Dune Messiah. It is an excellent novel about destiny and fate and how much of it we can control. We get more insight into the Navigators - here I noticed that, unlike in Dune, we actually meet a Navigator (one of the three primary conspirators against Paul Maud'dib) which means that David Lynch most have read this book as well before making his cult classic movie of the first book. We also learn more about the Bene Geserits and the Mentats. I found it particularly fascinating that the Butlerian Jihad, which takes place a few hundred years before the action in Dune and Dune Messiah, was actually, if I understood correctly, a war of humans against machines which the humans won. Following this victory, computers were banished from the known universe and instead Mentats and Navigators (inspired by melange made from spice) were bred to be human computers for political and financial strategy in the former case, and for navigation in space-time for the latter. This fascinated me because I have read and watched so much science fiction where the machines win (or are winning) such as in Ghost in the Shell or Neuromancer, or Blade Runner, or Hyperion and Dune is one of the rare universes where humans won and yet, at what cost? Banning machines seems to have brought humans back to a medieval society with its aristocracies (House Corrino, House Harkkonen, House Atreides) and oppression and genetic manipulation (Bene Gesserit). And once the Fremen rally around Paul to destroy two of the three houses and install Paul as the new Emperor and as the Dune Messiah, is this new regime really a new start for humanity or just another autocratic regime. It sure looks like that latter and we get inklings of this as the Fremen go spread the Gospel of their Maud'dib and subsequently spilling not just a little blood. All of these things continue to torture Paul as they did in Dune and yet he is inevitably driven forward by this messianic destiny. Enter the conspiracy of a Bene Gesserit priestess, a rogue Navigator and a strange Face Dancer who want to topple Paul's regime, well more specifically kill his Fremen wife and force him to sleep with his sister Alia (ewww!!) so as to continue the genetic engineering project and re-install the old regime over which each had more control than under Paul. Another piece of the puzzle here is the reappearance of Duncan Idaho, mentor and friend to Paul as a Zensunni master which has unintended consequences. Zensunnism in itself is a fascinating blend of Sunni Islam and Zen Buddhism that also is followed by the Freman. In essence, Herbert created a universe where classic monarchal hegemonies come into conflict with religious fanatics - in a sense we can see the Fremen hordes as marauding Zen Buddhist priests in ancient Japan fighting the Emperor, well that is one image that came into my mind anyway, so as not to wear out the old Western capitalism vs Islamic obscurantism trope.\n\nWhile perhaps less expansive and mind-blowing than the first Dune, Dune Messiah still delivers punches as a great plot with convincing characters and lots of philosophical questions. On to Children of Dune!\n\nI have since finished the whole canonical series and enjoyed all of it.\n\n[UPDATE] I am looking forward to Denis Villeneuve's Dune in October 2021. The previews I have seen so far seem to be quite coherent with respect to the book. I was a fan of Lynch's Dune and am curious to see what Villeneuve does with this one. Feel free to comment below.\n\nFino's Dune Reviews"}, {"label": "neutral", "text": "2.75/5\n\nYou know what's the worst thing about this series for me? The fact that although I like the plot and the main characters, Herbert's writing style makes me so detached from it all that after a while everything I like here, suddenly becomes dull.\n\nThe beginning of the second part of Dune was even engaging and I was drawn into the story, but to enjoy the rest I have to like the writing, which is not the case here. Unfortunately, I'm one of those readers where if the writing style doesn't suit me, the rest probably won't either. It took me days to finish the three-hundred-pages book, which usually takes me a day or two when I like the story. I think that in itself shows how much I enjoyed it.\n\nI must admit that the ending made me want to continue it, but I think I should take a short break from the world of Dune, because sadly for me this is not the type of series that I could binge read in a week. Maybe these are the type of books that I need to savor slowly to understand them better, or just like them more, I honestly don't know, but despite my low rating here, I will probably continue this series one day, when the right time comes."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "Buddy read with Athena!\n\n\"Once more the drama begins.\"\n- The Emperor Paul Muad'dib on his ascension to the Lion Throne\n\nTwelve years have passed since the Battle of Arrakeen, where Paul Atreides wrestled the Imperium from the hands of the Padishah Emperor, and seized the Lion Throne for himself. Dune has become the political and economical centre of the universe, and the Qizarate priesthood has spread Muad'dib's name throughout space and turned him into not only an emperor with absolute power, but a god in his own right.\n\nYet there are those who would topple the god emperor from his religious throne. In the grand circles of power, a new conspiracy arises from the shadows. Its goals and ambitions are many, and it seeks to infiltrate the ranks of the Atreides and the Fremen, striking at those closest to the emperor in order to remove him from power. And each step brings its plans closer to succeeding.\n\n\n\n\nis, in many ways, even better than . It cannot stand up to the wonder of discovering the world of Arrakis for the first time, but it certainly has other strengths. The setting and the writing style is mostly the same as in the first book. The story though, has changed dramatically. The first book is about Paul Atreides and his quest for vengeance against those who betrayed his family and seized their land. The second book is about managing an empire and protecting it from a devilishly dangerous conspiracy who shuns no means to achieve what they want. There is more political maneuvering, more hidden agendas, and more excitement for the reader.\n\nThe character have also grown more interesting in the second book. Paul, Chani and Irulan are all older and more experienced in the games of power, and were much more enjoyable to read about than they were in the first one. And perhaps the most fascinating character of them all is Alia, Paul's sister. Still only fifteen years of age, she is both a Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, a leader of the Qizarate priesthood, and a powerful voice in the Imperial Council.\n\nWhat truly made me decide to let this book keep the five stars from the first time I read it, was the ending. I will not go into details about it, but only say that this may be the most beautiful ending I have ever read in a sci-fi or fantasy book ever.\n\nFor those of you who have read and are debating with yourselves whether or not to read its sequels, I hope this review will be helpful in deciding. For those of you who haven't read any of the books from this universe, know that it is in my eyes one of the greatest fictional series of all time. I would definitely recommend it to every single one of you, because it's a wonderful story with few equals in the world of science fiction.\n\n\n- Dedication in the Muad'dib Concordance as copied from The Tabla Memorium of the Mahdi Spirit Cult"}, {"label": "negative", "text": "I really liked Frank Herbert's classic science fiction novel Dune when I first read it a few months ago --so much so that I named it one of the best books I read that year. But upon finally getting around to the sequel, Dune Messiah I'm pretty disappointed. It's really boring.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I can see some of the impressive literary clockwork that Herbert assembles in the book. Where Dune told the story of Paul Muad\u2019Dib's rise to the Emperor, controller of the universe's only source of the coveted super spice \"melange,\" and general badass dude, Messiah tells the story of his downfall. It also follows through on one of the more interesting concepts introduced in the first book: Paul's spice-induced ability to foresee the eventual species-wide extinction of humans and the hard choices he has to make in order to steer history towards a lesser evil. Indeed, Messiah fast forwards to a point where Paul's fanatic followers have propagated a holy war that has destroyed entire planets and left over 60 billion people dead in just a few years. By those measures, Paul is the worst monster history has ever created, yet he has to bear the mostly private burden of knowing that he's killing all those people to save the race as a whole while simultaneously trying to outmaneuver his political opponents and crafty assassins. Angst!\n\nThe problem I have with Messiah is that it suffers acutely from a kind of talking head syndrome. It's not until the back sixth or so of the book that anything interesting happens. Dune had sword fights, skirmishes, Paul and his mother tromping around the deadly desert of Arakis meeting and learning about the Fremen, and all other kinds of adventures. Messiah devotes literally dozens of pages at a time to sitting in a room listening to conspirators talk to each other. And then talking about what the talking means. And then thinking about what the talking about the talking means. It's terrible and jarring to see how Herbert has switched gears so abruptly from fascinating adventure and world building to stark exposition and naval gazing.\n\nNot that some of the ideas aren't interesting. The way that Paul must grapple with his precognition and how he has to grasp at things to try and leave humanity on the path to survival in the wake of his inevitable fall is a complex and fascinating idea, for one. And I liked the idea of how his strengths are the things that ultimately do him in --sometimes literally. It's just that I wish Herbert had found ways to make this story less tedious in its execution.\n\nIs the third book any better? I'm on the fence at this point."}, {"label": "neutral", "text": "3,5/5"}, {"label": "positive", "text": "Dune Messiah (Dune #2), Frank Herbert\n\nDune Messiah is a science fiction novel by American writer Frank Herbert, the second in his Dune series of six novels. Twelve years after the events described in Dune (1965), Paul \"Muad'Dib\" Atreides rules as Emperor.

From re-discovering characters and themes, to gaining an understanding that my seventeen-year-old brain wasn't able to yet comprehend. \n\nAs a note on my assessment style: Part of me wants to respond to other reviewers here on Goodreads concerning their literary criticisms. However, I\u2019ve found that to be a self-defeating endeavor. I come from the school of: A review should stand on its own merits. But I have a little cheat here - I can respond to what my younger self thought of . The Nick West of twenty years ago did have some criticisms of this book that may have been rooted in misunderstanding \u2014 and at the very least, a sense of disappointment or superb literary let-down. As I respond to Nick of the 90s, you can parallel similar themes in other 2 and 3 star reviews on this site.\n\nSo here we are: You the reader, Nicholas at age 37, and Nick at age 17. Let\u2019s chat.\n\n**(There is one specific thing I do want to address concerning other reviews, because it\u2019s a weirdly specific critique that pops up a bunch of times. But we\u2019ll get there in a minute.)**\n\nOff the top here, I loved this book. I had it on my Goodreads for 10 days, but really I ate up the bulk of the text in a three day page-burner.\n\nHere\u2019s something that Nick, age 17, could not fully realize about : This is a novel for grown ups. Gone is the fairy-tale magic of a young man forced into extraordinary circumstances. Gone are any aspects to the beginnings of the hero\u2019s journey.\n\nInstead, we get the biggest realization that Nicholas at age 37 has had about the series: Those aspects of fantasy and science fiction tropes that got me into the story, seemingly became absent concepts in Book Two. While not , those surface elements are the thing that I got hung up on the first time I read this series. And they weren\u2019t even the most important things in the saga.\n\nFrank Herbert has this reputation for making some impenetrable document as rigid, complicated, and vengeful as the Old Testament. But that\u2019s a bad rap. On the surface, the first book was a seemingly simple story of betrayal and revenge. The world building, interpersonal relationships, religious philosophies, and political intrigue are as deep as anything ever put into fiction. (The vengeful part is, however, accurate.)\n\nSo, when teenage Nick finished ; what felt like the most epic journey my imagination had ever been on, only to crack open the next book and feel like I was thrust into the pages of a bad pulp novel, it felt a bit confusing.\n\nI read the prologue which contained on-the-nose dialogues by some nameless jailer and a historian. Okay? \u2014 The empire of Paul Maud\u2019dib has a Spanish Inquisition team?\n\nThe next chapter introduced me to Face Dancers, gaseous fish-men, and a conspiracy to kick the book into gear \u2014 It is a little pulpy. But the Harkonnens are pretty damn pulpy too. As adversaries they are supervillain-gaga. Maybe you just missed it missed it because of how epic the story was around them.\n\nGeez, young Nick, you didn\u2019t realize it was pulp all along. With a healthy dose of psychedelia and the best world building since Tolkien. As to the confusion of the prologue, turns out that\u2019s just a clever way to deliver exposition on what became of the Universe since Paul ascended to emperorship: It\u2019s been twelve years since the first book, etc\u2026\n\nPulp might be the wrong word. But the heart of the matter is that Herbert had a vision (visions!) in which he used , Book One, to dip a toe in, or maybe a foot. But with , we definitely went waist deep. What\u2019s third base in a swimming mixed metaphor? I think Frank Herbert reached his hand down my pants from a psychedelic standpoint.\n\nBut I\u2019m skipping ahead. Nick at 17 was let down. My expectations had been subverted. isn\u2019t about the Shakespearean characters performing hyper-slick action scenes. No. Book Two in the series is much more contemplative. We jump into new dramas between old characters and fresh faces. And yes, teenage Nick, there is a hell of a lot of talking. But to call that boring or hard to follow betrays an unrefined mind, kid. This novel is a procedural of emotion, passion, pleasure, the struggle with mortality \u2014 you know, the human condition \u2014 Not only did Frank Herbert up his literary game; he did so with a brevity and beauty that was perfect for this story. And what we think of as a slow burn actually has new twists and intrigues on practically every other page. If you pay attention, which the writing makes easy to do, the payoff is a powerful one indeed.\n\nOn that note: Paul Maud\u2019dib is dealing with some heavy stuff as Emperor of the known Universe. He had allowed (Or he claimed it as out of his control) a horrible Jihad to rage across the universe. This Holy War is what I struggled with the most both times I read the novel \u2014 and perhaps Herbert was using this as a way to expand the reader\u2019s consciousness? (This is a meta theory if you tie it into the Ghola/Hayt/Duncan Idaho\u2019s fate. Whoa. There\u2019s a thesis, man\u2026) You really have to open up new channels of thought to figure out why Paul could not stop evil from being done in the Atreides name. Was there really was no order of events or commands that could\u2019ve stopped the Fremen conquerers?\n\n\n\nSo now we get into the goods. Here\u2019s what makes this book such a killer, twelve-round-fight-with-a-knockout-punch, genius piece of literature.\n\nPaul faces several huge problems that seem insurmountable. And he feels trapped by his prescience. If one could see the future and decided on a certain path, the sheer boredom would be brutal. But there is still too much fear for the boredom to kick in. There is a complicated conspiracy against him that is so powerful, even his knowledge of the plot cannot stop its machinations. Paul must produce an heir. If this is done improperly, the love of his life would be tortured and turned into a slave. the Jihad must be stopped. The unbalanced government fueled by religious zealots needs to be set on a more progressive track.\n\nThat\u2019s quite a tall order for 329 pages.\n\nOn top of that, we are told in the prologue about Paul\u2019s downfall. So now we\u2019re faced with a whodunnit?, or more of a howdunnit? Will the conspirators win the day? Can Paul cement a legacy that reaches beyond violence? Can Chani bear a child that lives?\n\nSo we sit through all the meetings, and conversations that take place jumping between multiple points-of-view. We delve into character\u2019s deepest thoughts, passions, desires, and inadequacies \u2014 something that Herbert can actually pull off. What could have been a mess of massive internal dialogues, instead becomes a string, a chord, and finally a cable pulling the reader forward page by page. Yes, young Nick. How could you understand the anxiety a father feels for his children? Or a husband for his wife of more than a decade? You really can\u2019t. Frank Herbert wrote a book for grown ups. And when you\u2019re all grown up, you might catch a bit of what was trying to be conveyed. All the while being heaped with a massive dose of trippy visions pulling you into the undertow of genetic and higher-thinking philosophies.\n\n\n\nYou try writing something half as spectacular.\n\nSo, teenage Nick, give it some time, buddy. comes highly recommended from you, a man who has changed a little bit over the last twenty years.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n**Finally here\u2019s that weird note that pops up in a bunch of Goodreads reviews. I\u2019ll go ahead and quote some actual reviews here (Of course, I\u2019m not going to call out individual names. I\u2019m not here to pick a fight. These reviewers have just as much validity in their feelings towards the book as I do.) added by me.\u2014\n\n\u201cI'm realizing there's not much to this book. It simply the first and third.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter re-reading Dune recently, I decided to finally get around to reading Dune Messiah - the sequel to Dune and the to Children of Dune.\u201d\n\n\u201cI read in reviews all over the Internet that it was boring that it was basically only a between DUNE and CHILDREN OF DUNE.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me Dune Messiah acts as a slightly dull (but not too shabby) to go on to the original trilogy\u2019s grand finale Children of Dune\"\n\n(This next one says the same thing but surprisingly doesn\u2019t use the key word, . Seriously, what is going on here?)\n\n\u201cThe feel of the book is like a prelude to what comes next, that the third book will be the true sequel to Dune.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not to say I didn't love the book -- far from it! It definitely feels like a book between \"Dune\" and \"Children of Dune\u201d\u201d\n\nYou get the point. At least 30 different reviews used this terminology in my quick scan.\n\nFirstly: What the hell is going on? Did everyone read each other\u2019s reviews and just spew the same points using their own re-ordered sentences? Is there some secret -whisperer-critic that said this is a \u201cbridge\u201d novel and that became reality for everyone else? Seriously, wtf?\n\nSecondly: I think most of these folks are wrong. You could stop the series at and have a really satisfying ending to Paul\u2019s journey. Honestly, is one of the best damn endings I\u2019ve ever read. It\u2019s a magic trick where the cards are face up the whole time and you\u2019re still left wondering how Frank Herbert pulled it off.\n\nGood stuff, Mr. Herbert. Young Nick, ignore these \u201c\u201d acolytes. I don\u2019t trust \u2018em. :P"}, {"label": "positive", "text": "a lot of people said that this book was bad but it\u2019s not? some people say to read it as an epilogue to Dune and after that it really helped my enjoyment of the book."}, {"label": "neutral", "text": "Oh, man, where the fuck do I really even start? When I've read Dune last year I fell head over heels in love with it. It had been such a long time since I've read a chunky sci-fi/fantasy novel and I seriously didn't expect to love that book, its characters, the world building, and its plot as much as I did.\nEmpires do not suffer emptiness of purpose at the time of their creation. It is when they have become established that aims are lost and replaced by vague ritual.\nAnd even though Dune had a somewhat closed ending, I was still curious to see where Paul Muad'Dib would end up. What would happen to Arrakis under his rule? To the Fremen? To the whole universe? I've heard many interesting takes on the series as a whole, and I am mainly interested in the philosophical questions of power, worship and human control over nature that it raises. Therefore, I knew that I had to give a shot, to piece the puzzle together, and to get more answers.\n\nI didn't nearly love it as much as I loved . had the big advantage of everything being new. I was introduced to Arrakis, to the Atreides, the Harkonnens; I saw the ornithopters, the Fremen stillsuits and the sandworms for the first time; I started to grasp the complexity of this world that Frank Herbert created. Whereas in , albeit the world has changed, it still feels oddly familiar. To me, the sequel didn't feel as fresh or new or even original. It felt more like the traditional sci-fi novels that I usually stay clear off.\n\nIn , Paul was a young boy who led a revolution against the tyranny of the Padishah empire. However, when he ascended the throne as emperor, a jihad got unleashed in his name, leading to the death of 61 billion people. He became a failed hero. Heroes who fail to recognise their humanity fall into an abyss of desolation forged from the failures they encounter once realism dawns on them.\nshows how deadly religion can get once it has a cause that fuels it. Paul knows that even if he were to disappear or die, he wouldn't be able to stop the jihad, he'd simply become a martyr, a God, fuelling the jihad even more. The people fighting in his name have become fanatics, succumbed to a cause that will never let them out of its grips.\nIn , we find many interesting musings on power and freedom: \"Power tends to isolate those who hold too much of it. Eventually, they lose touch with reality \u2026 and fall.\", \"Any delusions of Free Will he harboured now must be merely the prisoner rattling his cage. His curse lay in the fact that he the cage.\", and \"Too much freedom breeds chaos.\"\n\nI wish I had found the time (or energy) to contemplate these a lot more, because I really like how Herbert subverts the (white) savior trope in this series. Paul is a failed hero. And for that, he is the most interesting character in these books. We see the paradoxes surrounding him. So, I really like what Herbert has to say about the nature of power, and how it corrupts (not just the person who holds it but also the cause for which it is used), however, I have to admit that I haven't (yet) dived deep into an interpretation of the series. I think I will save that for when I've finished . I can't wait to read all the hot takes and watch video essays on it.\n\nNow let's discuss some of the things I really didn't enjoy this book \u2013 and why it ultimately left me a little bit disappointed.\n\nSimilarly to , Frank Herbert's writing style is just really not my cup of tea. I don't think that his writing is beautiful nor effective. Whilst I love his world building and appreciate the complexity of the universe he created, I have to admit that I struggle with visualising any of his descriptions. Therefore, I was very happy that I could bounce off the visuals of Denis Villeneuve's new film. They really helped me picture the world whilst reading.\n\nHowever, as new characters and elements of the world are introduced in , I struggled with visualising them. It's not that Herbert doesn't describe them, it's just he does it that doesn't work for me. I always end up picturing the most ridiculous things possible. For example, if you compare Herbert's descriptions of the members of the Spacing Guild \u2013 \"Edric swam in a container of orange gas \u2026 The Guildsman was an elongated figure, vaguely humanoid with finned feet and hugely fanned membraneous hands \u2013 a fish in a strange sea. His tank\u2019s vents emitted a pale orange cloud rich with the smell of the geriatric spice, melange.\" \u2013 to Denis Villeneuve's cool design for the movie:\n\n\n\nIt's not hard to pick a favorite. Herbert's description seems so ... weird? A fish-like figure swimming in an orange gas tank? What is that supposed to look like? How is that practical for the story? How does Edric move forward? Isn't he super vulnerable because people could just break his tank?? What is happening? Whereas in the movie, the Spacing Guild looks fucking epic, even intimidating. They have a much more -y design. And I can take them seriously. In the movie, they are much more believable.\n\nAnother example is the Dune Tarot. Up to this day, I don't understand what its function is or how it even works. It's an oracular tool (basically Tarot cards?) sold in markets on Arrakis. For some reason, that is never properly explained, the existence of the Tarot muddles Paul's and Alia's ability to see the future. Wait, what? How? And why? Because there are more prophets. It makes no sense. Also, just picturing Fremen dealing with Tarot cards is too fucking funny to me. Again, it's a part of the world that would've probably been really cool and epic in the films, but in the book, I fail to take it seriously.\n\nMy biggest gripe with , however, is what Frank Herbert did to the character of Alia. She had such great potential in , being the youngest and most powerful Reverend Mother, I couldn't wait to see her as a teenager (she is 15 at the beginning of ), so that she could become more integral to the plot.\n\nInstead of fleshing out her character and giving her an important role (which would suit her powers), Herbert does nothing but sexualise her throughout the entirety of the novel. It was frustrating, and even disgusting at times, but let me elaborate: It all started going to shit right off the bat, when the Tleilaxu admit that their plan is to distract her by making her fall in love with Hayt: \"She is of an age when she can be distracted by a charming male designed for that purpose. She will be attracted by his maleness and by his abilities as a mentat.\"\n\nSo, you're telling me, one of the most powerful creatures of this universe will get distracted and lured into a trap by a man? Umm, okay, sure. Keep on dreaming, Herbert.\n\nI really don't understand why Herbert was so obsessed with stressing the point that now, at age 15, Alia has her sexual awakening: \"It was lust in tension with chastity, she thought. Her flesh desired a mate. Sex held no casual mystery for a Reverend mother who had presided at the sketch orgies.\" I mean, what is happening??? Why is that necessary?? Paul didn't go through a sex-crazy phase when he was a teenager in , so why must Alia?\n\nThe lowest of low points was the scene in which Alia decides to do target practice naked: \"Abruptly, Alia climbed dripping from the bath, strode wet an naked into the training chamber which adjoined her bedroom.\" The whole scene was so muddled by the male gaze it was hard to bear. Women do not enjoy fighting naked. It's not practical, Herbert. Titties bouncing all over the place. It hurts. And the way Herbert described this naked 15-year old (!!!) girl \u2013 \"Sweat glistened on her naked skin.\" \u2013 made me very uncomfortable. It was disgusting.\n\nWhen Alia is discovered by her brother Paul and Stilgar, Frank Herbert once again showed that he's a man and doesn't understand teenage girls: \"Alia, growing conscious of her nudity, thought to cover herself, found the idea amusing. What the eyes had seen could not be erased.\" Absolutely not. Girls don't find it amusing when their brothers see them naked?? What is going on with you??\n\nIn general, Herbert tried to establish somewhat of a sexual tension between Alia and Paul (...who is 30 at this point, mind you \u2013 AND HER FUCKING BROTHER) \u2013 \"Paul took his time reading the reactions on her face and body: the flush of her exertions colouring her skin, the wet fulness of her lips. There was a disquieting femaleness about her that he had never considered in his sister.\" \u2013 and I wasn't here for any of that. It was soooo unnecessary to the plot, and just disgusting. When Paul noticed that \"Yes \u2013 there\u2019d been a ruttish air about Alia.\" I actually wanted to throw my copy of the book away. I mean, what the fuck is going on here, Frank? Can we focus, please?\n\nAnother way that Alia was thrown under the bus in this novel is her relationship to Hayt/Duncan. Alia, the most powerful and most KNOWLEDGEABLE creature in the universe (having absorbed all the knowledge of all Reverend Mothers before her), becomes a naive and silly girl in front of Hayt and his \"male confidence\" (her words, not mine...). At the end of the book, she literally says to him: \"'I need you, Duncan,' she sobbed. 'Love me.'\" Are you fucking kidding me? How about you start using your powers and choosing your own destiny, instead of relying on this man (who kissed you without your consent btw)??? So yeah, Alia's character went DOWN THE DRAIN, and I'm still pissed about it.\n\nAnyways, what follows now is a very short summary of \u2013 which I will use for further reference once I get to (ya'll know that my memory is like a sieve) \u2013 so please beware of spoilers:\n\nTwelve years after Paul Atreides's ascension as emperor, the death toll of the jihad unleashed in his name peeks 61 billion people. Paul gains total control of Melange's production, making him the most powerful emperor to have ever ruled. Using his prescience, Paul tries to create a golden path for humanity.\nThe Bene Gesserit, Spacing Guild, and Tleilaxu come together to plot a plan that will lead to Paul's dethroning. Reverend Mother Gaius recruits Princess Irulan, Paul's consort, to work on the inside, and she does so by adding contraceptives into Chani's food, preventing her from conceiving for Paul. However, Chani gets pregnant after using a Fremen fertility diet. Scytale, the face dancer from the Tleilaxu, brings Paul a gift of Duncan Idaho's ghola, called Hayt. Paul's acceptance of Hayt creates a rift between him and the Fremen.\n\nPaul discovers a Fremen plot to kill him and confronts his opposition. Paul gets blinded by a Stone Burner. Paul tries negotiating Chani's life in exchange for artificially inseminating Princess Irulan. As foreseen, Chani dies in childbirth, and Hayt attacks Paul but recovers his former self.\n\nPaul kills Scytale by using his son's eyes after having received a prescient vision from the perspective of his newborn son. Paul then loses his own prescience in the act. Paul leaves his new twin babies in Alia's care and walks into the desert as a man as per the Fremen tradition. Alia orders the execution of Paul's enemies, including Reverend Mother Gaius and Edric. However, she spares Princess Irulan."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "4.5 Stars\n\nMel \ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udc36\ud83d\udc3a\ud83d\udc3e"}, {"label": "negative", "text": "Sometimes one book is enough. Sometimes less is more. Sometimes a story needs to be left alone.\n\nI have never been more disappointed with a sequel in my entire life. It\u2019s that bad I wish I never read it and I also wish that the author never wrote it because it adds absolutely nothing to the franchise. I\u2019m so surprised at how poor it is. I\u2019ve heard that the series gets worse with each book, and I can\u2019t imagine how it could get any worse than this. So, I\u2019m going to stop right here and save myself writing anymore negative reviews and wasting my time with bad writing.\n\nThe main problem is that nothing really happens. The plot is non-existent, which is surprising considering just how intricate the first book is. The world is huge, and Herbert could have done so much with it. Instead, he extended the story further than it should have been and the consequences are dire. The only point of interest, a resurrected character from the first book, fails to deliver the drama and tension he appears to bring with his presence.\n\nUltimately, because the first book is just so fantastic, the sequels will only ever be compared to it. It\u2019s how these things work. A series needs to be consistent in its imaginative power and it needs to be consistent in its drive and quality. This is so weak compared to the first book that I could only ever be disappointed. Whilst there are some interesting aspects, they suffer because the plot stays so stationery and frets over the ethics of religious jihad and Paul\u2019s impassivity in the face of his destiny.\n\nI also found the mention of real-world historical figures a little odd considering there was no mention of anything like this in the first novel. There is a comparison between Paul and Hitler, as Herbert considers who has killed more people during the act of conquest. And this threw me totally off because the series seemed very self-contained. It\u2019s like Richard III being mentioned in a Star Wars novel when the universe wasn\u2019t built on ours initially. This totally destroyed any sense of immersion in the plot.\n\nHerbert should have just stuck to one book or, better yet, actually wrote a decent sequel or something new.\n\n\n___________________________________\n\nYou can connect with me on social media via .\n__________________________________"}, {"label": "positive", "text": "Segunda entrega de la extraordinaria saga de Frank Herbert, Las cr\u00f3nicas de Dune, considerada una de las m\u00e1s importantes sagas de CF de todos los tiempos.\n\nUna joya memorable y atemporal que ser\u00e1 siempre el desierto de Arrakis.\n\nEl mes\u00edas de Dune contin\u00faa la historia de Paul Atreides, mejor conocido \u2013 y temido -, bajo el nombre de Muad\u2019Dib.

It does not work as a book, as there is really no beginning, just a slow (very, very slow and exposition-laden) flat-line of a narrative that gives a slight blip at the overly dramatic ending, which is clearly meant to set-up \u2018Children of Dune\u2019 rather than end the second book in any satisfactory fashion. I think \u2018Dune Messiah\u2019 is much better-suited as the last part of \u2018Dune\u2019 itself, where it would function as a reflective coda deconstructing the consequences of the preceding events.\n\nClearly, \u2018Dune Messiah\u2019 did little to deter the juggernaut that the Dune books would ultimately become. It had about as much effect as poor old Paul trying to avert the jihad and prevent humanity going off the rails of civilisation. Paul spends pretty much the entire book in an existential funk, pondering his increasingly opaque and contradictory visions (much to the frustration of the patient reader, who still has no clue as to what it is he is actually \u2018seeing\u2019.)\n\nIn a throwaway line so typical of much of the off-hand nature of \u2018Dune Messiah\u2019, as if Herbert was deliberately trying to avoid emulating anything that characterised the previous book (and that had made readers fall in love with it), Paul compares notes with fellow \u2018emperors\u2019 Genghis Khan and Hitler:\n\nThis is well into the book\u2019s last act, and does make the reader raise an eyebrow. Oh, so that\u2019s why Paul is in such a bad mood! Apparently, it is barely 12 years after the ending of \u2018Dune\u2019, a rather odd number that I\u2019ve seen bandied about but don\u2019t recall being referenced in the actual text. A vast bureaucracy known as the Qizarate has arisen to administer (and temper) the religious fanaticism that has arisen around Paul.\n\nA pilgrimage route known as the \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdhajj\u2019 is well-established by now, with Arrakis as its ultimate destination, ensuring that the Qizarate\u2019s coffers are always overflowing. Jessica, however, wants nothing to do with this:\n\n\n\n\nThe main plot of \u2018Dune Messiah\u2019 concerns the machinations of a \u2018fellowship\u2019 of disparate stakeholders drawn into an uneasy alliance with the common purpose of unseating Paul from his throne. Herbert is always very precise about his terminology, and I am sure his reference to a \u2018company of conspirators\u2019 is a deliberate inversion of how the term \u2018fellowship\u2019 is used in \u2018Lord of the Rings\u2019, for example, the other contemporary countercultural novel that \u2018Dune\u2019 is often compared with.\n\nWhile we have the usual suspects like Mohiam and Irulan, it is the new characters and players introduced into the mix that really elevates \u2018Dune Messiah\u2019 into something special. If you thought \u2018Dune\u2019 could not get any weirder than the quasi-mystical mumbo jumbo of the original, then \u2018Dune Messiah\u2019 quickly makes you realise that Herbert still has quite a number of cards up his sleeve (there is a lovely riff on the Dune Tarot set throughout the book.)\n\nBijaz, described as a dwarf Tleilaxu oracle, is a weird combination of Falstaff from Shakespeare and Chucky from the Child\u2019s Play movies, and would not be out of place in a David Lynch movie. Speaking of Lynch, he obviously nicked Edric the mutated Guild Navigator straight from the pages of \u2018Dune Messiah\u2019, turning it into an indelible image in SF cinema.\n\nHerbert seems to be a fan of baroque excess, as evinced by the flamboyant and thoroughly despicable Baron in \u2018Dune\u2019. In \u2018Dune Messiah\u2019, however, he introduces yet another shadowy player that is potentially even more perverse and grotesque, the Bene Tleilax. Just where the hell did they come from? Despite the ancient proscription on using computers that arose from the Butlerian Jihad, the Tleilaxu is clearly the predecessor of LexCorp, always flirting with dangerous technology:\n\n\n\nThe best demonstration of the overriding creepiness of the Bene Tleilax, of course, is their presentation of a special gift to Paul, a ghola of Duncan Idaho himself, plucked from the battlefield and reanimated like Frankstein\u2019s monster in an axolotl tank (clearly an inversion of the Fremen death still). Alia of the Knife, whom Herbert often reminds the reader is on the cusp of her womanhood, as if there is a noxious whiff of the Baron still hanging around, is immediately turned on by Hayt, the ghola\u2019s Tleilaxu name. Not subtle at all, Herbert.\n\nAlia attempts to work off some steam by sparring with an updated version of the fighting machine that Paul used on Caladan in \u2018Dune\u2019 (this one even has flashing lights.) Except she does so in the nude. Yes, sex rears its head in \u2018Dune Messiah\u2019 like Shai Hulud popping up out of the sand. (A lot of SFX ingenuity in Lynch\u2019s 1984 \u2018Dune\u2019 went into preventing the sandworms looking like questing penises. Lynch was only partially successful, but that could have been deliberate on his part.)\n\nHerbert reminds us that orgies were a commonplace occurrence in the Fremen sietch (if you recall, Paul first had sex with Chani in the spice-induced orgy after he kills Jamis in single-handed combat.) We even get a quotation from Chapter 3 of The Steersman\u2019s Guild, entitled \u2018THE ORGY AS A TOOL OF STATECRAFT\u2019. And as if the Bene Gesserit weren\u2019t in the reader\u2019s bad books already, here they hatch a desperate plot to attempt to get Paul to fuck his sister.\n\nPoor sexually-deprived Irulan wonders idly about Edric the Guild Navigator as a potential fuck buddy, \u201cthinking how odd it would be to mate with such a one.\u201d This, mind you, during the first meeting of the conspirators that opens the book, where her mind should be focusing on the larger issues and not be in the gutter (or Edric\u2019s tank, as it were.) Mohiam fondly calls Lady Jessica a \u201ctraitorous bitch\u201d, who in turn is told by Scytale: \u201cYou are not a sex object, have never been a sex object, cannot be a sex object.\u201d Ouch. That had to hurt as much as the gom jabbar.\n\nAh, Scytale. Described as a \u2018Jadacha hermaphrodite\u2019, he (pronouns weren\u2019t as advanced in 1969 when \u2018Dune Messiah\u2019 was published), can assume either sex at will, and is commonly referred to as a Face Dancer. \u201cFor the present, I am a man,\u201d he declares. The reader is not convinced, because there is something even oilier about Scytale than that uber-creep the Baron. It is especially uncomfortable because Herbert seems to signpost a latent effeminacy or sexual ambiguity in Scytale as being fundamentally wrong. It is clear that a lot of the convoluted sexual politics of \u2018Dune\u2019, wrapped up as it were in Herbert\u2019s own subconscious biases towards misogyny and homophobia, begin to, er, come into play in \u2018Dune Messiah\u2019.\n\n\u2018Dune Messiah\u2019 is the literary equivalent of a \u2018spice blow\u2019, which is the result of immense pressure building up within a pre-spice mass deep within the sands of Arrakis. (Of course, this is what killed Liet Kynes when he rather stupidly went to lay on top of one in \u2018Dune\u2019.) At only about a third of the length of the original novel, so much is packed into \u2018Dune Messiah\u2019 that a spice blow is inevitable.\n\nHerbert\u2019s writing is always at its most delicate and evocative when he turns to Arrakis itself, and \u2018Dune Messiah\u2019 is no exception. He clearly has a deep and abiding love for the desert world he has created, which is a tabula rasa of the natural world despoiled by humanity and its increasingly dramatic and uncontrollable impact on our own planet. There is a wonderful scene near the end when Chani returns to her sietch to give birth (and precipitate the crisis that launches the next book in the sequence):\n\n\n\n\nAs far as I recall, this is the only worm sighting in the entire book, apart from a side plot involving a bunch of Fremen traitors capturing a small maker to take it off-planet and start the spice cycle on a similar world. Ah, but they don\u2019t know about the sand plankton that is such an integral part of the sandworm lifecycle, which is probably what George Lucas had in mind when he started tinkering with the role of midichlorians as an essential component of the Star Wars universe.\n\nHerbert continues:\n\n\n\n\nExtraordinary. And it is exactly as if the reader him- or herself has returned home, to the deep desert of Arrakis where it all began. Chani\u2019s viewpoint is reflected in Paul\u2019s own perspective:\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, I know that this is Herbert at his most \u2018hippy dippy\u2019 \u2013 and it is certainly no surprise that a novel as batshit crazy as this would have such a deeply Age of Aquarius moment in it. But, for me, this is still one of the most remarkable, and memorable, passages in the entire saga.

To begin your study of the life of Dune, then, take care that you first place this in its proper time.\n\nKnow then that it is the year 2021 and all the covidiots and Q factions have taken over the universe. What was once an act of glorious revenge against a teetering empire has now become an entrenched tragedy.\n\nReading Dune Messiah is the tragedy that we deserve. Taken over by religious zealots, icons over careful deliberation, countless dead instead of a stable empire.\n\nBut that's where the comparison fails. Paul, unlike any of us, has a much clearer idea of the future, being able to see it, however imperfectly, and he is caught in a web of intrigue and guile and that beautiful sliver of hope hidden in the future that only his eyes see, where only perfidy, assassination, and betrayal seems to be his new bed.\n\nTwelve years after the end of Dune, Alia is a teenager and a bright star. Irulan wants an heir to the Empire, Chani is a devoted but flattened character, as is Paul, as all futures grind down to singular points. The time of crisis comes and tragedy, depression, and horror awaits.\n\nBut at least there is a copy of Duncan Idaho.

Frank Herbert returned to Arrakis for a book that was very different from the action packed first volume of the series, but at the same time, still held a lot of the familiar. When I tell people that I actually enjoyed the sequel to Dune more than the original, the answer I get from the overwhelming majority is, \"Wait . . . Dune has a sequel?\" People know of Dune nowadays through the 1984 cult classic movie. Some people may be vaguely aware that the movie was based on a book, but never bothered to pick it up or look for sequels. Which is a shame, because they're missing out on this little gem of a book.\n\nTwelve years after taking the throne of the empire for himself in Dune, Paul \"Muad'Dib\" Atreides has become something of a God, or Savior figure to the Fremen, who have taken up arms and spread out throughout the entire known universe bringing a Holy War to subjugate all beneath his rule. All of this, very much against Paul's own wishes. He has become a figurehead, standing atop the empire as Emperor, while priests of the religion that worships him rule in his name. He has made good his promise to begin turning Dune into a paradise, and now the desert runs freely with water. Another sign to his followers of his godhood.\n\nPrincess Irulan, Paul's trophy wife, and the means by which he secured the throne is anxious to follow her Bene Gesserit orders to bear the royal heir, but Paul has no love for her and refuses it to her, instead remaining true to his real, Fremen wife Chani. This leads Irulan to join a conspiracy against the Emperor, meant to discredit him, destroy his reputation, and take the wind out of the Fremen Zealots' sails. Out of spite, she has been feeding Chani contraceptives to prevent her from ever bearing Paul an heir, but this plan failed, and Chani conceived anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Good? Again, Frank Herbert did a ridiculous amount of research before writing this book. It shows in how he truly understands the mechanics of economics, politics, and religion. The religion that he has built up around Paul is intriguing, and realistic, and the atrocities that its zealots commit in his name feel logical, and realistic as well.\n\nPaul's suffering under the burden of the sins of those who follow him is really well done. This book is more a character study on him, than really anything else, showing the impact his actions have had on him as a person. This is a very different kind of book than the first in the series. Where the first book was all about war, this one is all about the consequences of it on the man that started it all. Despite its short length, this book has a very big and important message, and it delivers it exquisitely. Many people tend to complain that this book is rather boring after the first one, but I found Paul's inner struggles to be just as, or perhaps even more entertaining than the battles of conquest and Paul's coming of age, etc from the first book.\n\nThis book is remarkably better written and put together than the first book. Not only did Frank Herbert apparently do quite a bit of research in the four years between books, but he also improved on his skills as a writer quite a bit. The storyline is tighter, less convoluted and far less confusing than that of the first book. It almost reads like something written by a completely different writer because of the increased quality of the writing, and the change of focus, but at the same time, it still has his unique style and flair to it.\n\nThe Bad? I have never liked the Third Person Omniscient perspective that Frank Herbert uses. This is where the story is told by a narrator in third person that will change viewpoints between characters at the drop of a hat, without warning when any given character has any important thoughts or observations on what's going on. I find it to be rather confusing and distracting at times, and I've always thought of the style as rather amateurish. This is wholly a point of opinion, and true, many very good books are written in this particular perspective, but I don't like it, and will always count it as a bad mark against any book it appears in.\n\nFrank Herbert doesn't really seem to \"get\" female characters. He doesn't really seem to understand what motivates women, how they think, how they act, how they talk, and why they do the things that they do. Going by his female characters, one could almost say that he never met a real woman in his life. As such, they are basically just men with breasts. They have all the right girly bits, because someone in the universe has to, but the their minds and personalities are about the furthest thing from feminine as is possible. Back in the '60s this was a VERY common thing, which is getting somewhat better these days, but still lingers on. Frank Herbert's portrayal of women fits those of the times, but to anyone that might be, or has ever actually met, a real woman before, it's going to feel a bit off. Back in the day this sort of thing was acceptable, but I find it to be annoying and distracting, if not downright offensive, in this day and age.\n\nIn conclusion, Dune Messiah is a VERY different type of book than its predecessor Dune, and it does have its vices, but the good more than outweighs the bad by far. The focus on Paul's dilemma with the Jihad that he inadvertently started is spectacular. Watching his inner turmoil over the countless billions that have died in his name play out is excellent. And if the female characters are off, everything else is dead on. He's created a fantastic world, with fantastic people (if you think of them all as men, anyway) to live in it, and did a great deal of research to make everything from the economics to the religion feel realistic. As an entry in the Dune Saga, it's probably one of the best."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "I'm very much looking forward to Villeneuve's interpretation of Dune that will be shown in theaters this year so I decided to not only read the original book but also the rest of the series.\n\nAfter seizing power and becoming emperor by marrying Princess Irulan, Paul (well, his forces, but in his name nonetheless) has sterilized hundreds of planets, killed billions of people ... and hates his own Jihad (I loved Scytale's description of it being a mental epidemic). Paul doubts the justice and righteousness of the path he has chosen, his powers of vision encounter more and more limits, and the number of people opposing the new emperor grow ever more. Even some Fremen despise Muad'ib now. While Paul and his now 15-year-old sister, Alia, rule with a council, Irulan joins a conspiracy to kill Paul. Simultaneously, Chani wishes for nothing more than to be pregnant again (not knowing that\n) but Irulan herself demands the privilege of bearing her empirial husband's child (and is refused, unless she accepts artificial insemination). As if all that wasn't enough, the Navigator Guild establishes an embassy on Arrakis and brings a gift (funny, considering the German word Gift): a genetic copy of Paul's former friend and teacher, Duncan Idaho. He has a part to play, of course, knows and reveals as much as he knows about it even, but things are ... complicated. Once again, everything is shrouded in lies and mysteries and tarots, partially revealed by and often misunderstood thanks to visions.\n\nSo yes, there is a lot of intrigue and personal drama here. Where the first book was about fear and self-awakening, this second one more carried the tones of self-hatred and being trapped. What I especially liked about this book is that it addressed the conflict attentive readers saw coming in the previous book: how Paul had seized power and what he presented himself as to his followers could only lead to disaster. Not to mention the downside of his powers, the price he has to pay for them. Yet there were good reasons for him to do what and how he did (preventing annihilation for humanity). Nevertheless, seizing the throne is way easier than keeping it. And religious fanatism always carries within itself the seed of its own destruction.\n\nNaturally, the sandworms still are vital to the machinations and events. Here, plans are set in motion to create another melange \"factory\" on another planet.\nThen there were the further revelations of the complicated genetic tapestry the Bene Gesserit have weaved, the consequences, the history (for example, they aren't the only ones with such planning and Paul apparently\n)!\n\nPersonally, I liked and dreaded\nsince I know where it leads to (if the mini series follow the book(s) faithfully) - good and bad, necessary and preventable. Likewise, I knew what would happen to\n, also thanks to the mini series , but hated it and was hoping it would be different here - which was, of course, impossible.\nSo I was definitely emotionally invested and appropriately devastated.\n\nThis book, then, offers an important insight into Paul's conflict with himself and his different personas/potentials. It also shows the same kind of insight into Alia's mind (very important considering her having awakened to Reverend Mother awareness before she was even born and, no doubt, her future role). Last but not least, it sets the tone and places important corner stones for future developments. Because if you thought this series was about Paul, you better think again!\n\nA short-ish book, very cerebral with little actual action but still thrilling thanks to the reader excitedly following the path and the story being rounded off by the periodical interludes in the fashion of historical assessments and commentary, all of which is vital to the overall mythology and establishment of important characters that will carry the rest of the saga forward. It doesn't hurt that the author is so good at making you care about certain people in a short amount of time.\n\n\n\nP.S.: Don't let the rating fool you, this is not quite as good as the first novel.

Elements of those other aspects are still in place, but the story this time around is from people sitting at tables and discussing the existence of fate and ways to avoid prophesy rather than overthrowing evil barons. In fact, there are times where I felt that it hardly seems like a full novel, and more like a series of short scenes Herbert wrote, pat himself on the back over how clever they were and then decided to try to tie them all together.\n\nNow some of you may be sitting there going, oh, I guess that means you didn\u2019t like it then Tim? HA I say! The philosophy was what appealed to me the most of those aspects mentioned in Dune! I can read about people sitting at tables and talking for hours!\n\n\u2026\n\nBut yeah, I\u2019d be lying if I said there weren\u2019t a few parts where it got a bit old, and I wished for the descriptions of the desert, the plots within plots within plots\u2026 but by the end, I was satisfied as they were there all along, you just have to look closer to see them in play. In fact, by the end I realized that it was an extremely well developed novel, and that it was I who was at fault for not seeing the intricacies at play. Herbert demands your full attention to see what\u2019s going on all around.\n\nWhich brings me to the thing Herbert does best in this novel; one of the big aspects of the Dune series thus far is that he gives you every main character\u2019 thought process. There is no main POV character in each chapter, he will give you the thoughts of everyone, thus showing who thinks they are fooling who and who is actually fooled. He does this and he plays it fair the entire time, yet still manages to hide plot points in plain sight, and it is extremely well played.\n\nThe first book was a masterpiece in terms of world building, here that takes a backseat to prophesies and philosophy, but Herbert does manage to introduce at least one fascinating new aspect to his universe. The Face Dancers are introduced as assassins and shape shifters. One can walk into the room a pudgy male guard and leave as a small servant girl. They take contracts, but with a sense of honor and a condition; they must always leave the would be victim with an opportunity to escape. They need to know they are in danger and must be presented with an out. I find this new aspect fascinating and would have loved to see a bit more of a focus on them.\n\nI want to close this review by briefly describing my favorite scene in the entire book; it is one of the scenes where people sit and talk at tables. An older Fremen discusses why he joined up in Paul\u2019s campaign. It wasn\u2019t glory or the spoils of war\u2026 it was because some of his friends described the sea, and he couldn\u2019t believe it. He felt it must be a prank. He then goes on to describe it to a character who has been to many worlds and obviously seen the sea many times, but the character finds himself absorbed in the Fremen\u2019s words and realizes that he\u2019s experiencing this description in an unusual way, lost in the story and seeing it with new eyes\u2026 I couldn\u2019t help but smile, as Herbert made me feel the same way. For a brief moment I forgot I was reading, and could hear this old voice telling me about the sea\u2026\n\nA well earned 4/5 stars, but with the notation for those who fell in love with the first novel that this is not a sweeping epic.

Among my own Golden Age pantheon of seminal writers such as Asimov, Clarke, Heinlein, Zelazny, Farmer, Simak and Smith, Herbert exerted a certain exotic allure.\n\nI recently reread \u2018Dune\u2019 and \u2018Dune Messiah\u2019 again, inspired by Denis Villeneuve\u2019s superlative Part 1 movie adaptation. Now in my early 50s, I was surprised at how well the diptych stands up against the test of time and memory.\n\nI do believe that \u2018Dune Messiah\u2019 is superior in how much layered texture it adds to its age-old monomyth, and how cleverly it subverts the narrative arc that seemed so inevitable in \u2018Dune\u2019. Yes, it is a total bummer of an ending, but it is an ending that is both psychologically and thematically astute.\n\n(Editor John W. Campbell certainly didn\u2019t think so, and rejected \u2018Dune Messiah\u2019 due to it being \u2018anti-heroic\u2019 \u2013 which is kind of ironic when you think how large the ideal of the anti-heroic figure looms in so much of modern SF and fantasy, especially the Hollywood superhero factory.)\n\nWhich brings me to \u2018Children of Dune\u2019, which can only be described as a gibbering hot mess of a novel. Actually, it foreshadows another trend in much modern SF \u2013 here\u2019s looking at you, Star Wars \u2013 to not only reveal too much detail, but to focus on so much extraneous minutiae that the overall story is completely lost in a maelstrom of granularity.\n\nA tiny example is the mythical sietch of Jacurutu, and the inordinate number of pages that Leto agonises over whether it even exists or not. When he actually arrives on its dusty, forgotten doorstep, he spends even more pages agonising over the actual reality of what he is seeing\u2026\n\nWell, of course \u2018real\u2019 Jacurutu turns out to be a sand-screen for the \u2018mythical\u2019 Jacurutu, which does exist, in fact, but is shrouded in even deeper mystery and obfuscation by yet another (mythical) name. It is this kind of unnecessary navel-gazing that turns \u2018Children of Dune\u2019 into an exceptionally tedious rabbit-hole of a novel that wallows in its own inflated sense of self-importance.\n\nIn a short but revealing note at the end of the book, Herbert weirdly states that portions of \u2018Children of Dune\u2019 were completed before the first two novels. And it does, indeed, read like a series of outtakes or discarded ideas strung together to make up a semblance of a plot.\n\n\u2018Dune\u2019 itself is by no means perfect, but it has a certain logic and narrative drive, not to mention pacing and attention to relevant detail (leaving much to the reader\u2019s imagination), that makes it a much greater whole than the sum of its parts.\n\nSadly, \u2018Children of Dune\u2019 struggles with way too many moving parts to gain any coherence, let alone narrative urgency. For example, the culmination of Leto\u2019s conversion process, which drives perhaps the last third of the novel, is completely botched and butchered by Herbert.\n\nHe is way too busy keeping his characters speechifying preposterously and sententiously than to pay attention to the specific narrative mechanics of such a crucial and deeply weird scene. It is one of many such missed opportunities in the book, which rattles along as mindlessly as a sandworm in the great bled.\n\nHerbert has always been thought of as representing a \u2018colonial\u2019 approach to SF in that he portrays the terraforming of Arrakis as the end result of a just process of civilising the natives and uplifting them (more like bringing them to their senses from their barbaric ways.)\n\nIn this dialectic, a contemporary writer like Kim Stanley Robinson is perceived as the spiritual heir of Frank Herbert, tackling similar ideas of colonisation and politics, but with a much more modern approach that accounts for key, but often subtextual, influences such as cultural appropriation and authorial bias.\n\nIn \u2018Children of Dune\u2019, however, Herbert completely subverts his colonial label by introducing the jaw-dropping idea that the sand trout are not endemic to Arrakis, but are essentially an alien lifeform (where they came from and who introduced them is another story.)\n\nWhich makes the Fremen themselves a parasitic entity feeding off the lifecycle of Shai Hulud, instead of the noble oppressed savages and \u2018desert power\u2019 they were always thought to be. This plot strand is supposed to culminate in the transformation of Leto, but it peters out quite frustratingly rather than achieve the narrative crescendo it deserves.\n\nSeeing that so much of the book is about the consequences, shortfalls and perceived pitfalls of prescience, it is perhaps fitting that chunks were completed even before the first opening salvos of the trilogy (well, it started out as a trilogy.) And while on that subject, the whole bloody Golden Path gibberish makes no sense whatsoever.\n\nLeto is determined to remove Paul\u2019s stranglehold on humanity by effectively un-deifying his own father. But ends up following the very \u2018path\u2019 that Paul expressly chose not to follow, thereby promising to become an even bigger monster (literally) than Paul had ever been!?\n\n\nJust as Paul felt himself increasingly trapped by his own prescient visions, so does Herbert seem unable to break free from the plot cycle of the first two books. You thought Paul walked off bravely into the sunset at the end of \u2018Dune Messiah\u2019? Up pops the mysterious Preacher, decrying the empty religion of Alia. And where is a good villain when you need one \u2026 up pops the Baron (literally) in Alia\u2019s mind to pollute her consciousness with his conniving perversity.\n\nAnd forget about any tender Paul/Chani moments here either. Herbert is all matter-of-fact business, describing Leto\u2019s attraction to Sabiha (which does indeed mirror the Paul/Chani relationship) in the following totally romantic manner: \u2018There was an adult beefswelling in his loins \u2026\u2019 Okay, time to move along.\n\nThere was a seven-year gap between the publication of \u2018Dune Messiah\u2019 (1969) and \u2018Children of Dune\u2019 (1976), which is notable for being the first hardcover bestseller in the genre. Either readers did not know what they were in for, or they were much weirder than they are today. Probably the latter, lest we forget that \u2018Dhalgren\u2019 by Samuel R. Delany (1975) would go on to sell a million copies.\n\nAnother problem is that \u2018Children of Dune\u2019 veers rather determinedly away from SF into much choppier and murkier waters. The long (and I mean long) digressions on politics, governance and the philosophy of morality (or is it the morality of philosophy?) are simply stuffed into the mouths of characters who, ironically, increasingly come across as robotic in a universe where the very notion of AI is anathema and deemed to be anti-human.\n\nAs with \u2018Dune Messiah\u2019, there are some passages of nature writing where Herbert\u2019s singular passion for the raw environment, and his technical proficiency as a writer, combine to create such haunting passages as the below:\n\n\n\nBut it is too little, too late. The worm has, indeed, turned for this ambitious saga, which cannot escape its own Golden Path into repetitive dissolution."}, {"label": "neutral", "text": "There are two schools of thought on the Dune series. One is that they are epic, revelatory scifi all the way through, one is that after the glorious first book you traverse a lonely, winding path of diminishing returns in the sequels. I'm going to throw in with the latter group. Herbert created a fascinating, fully realized universe with Dune, and it was a joy to dive back into it: the Fremen, the litany against fear, the melange, the Atreides Battle Language. The point of Herbert's whole series is the inevitable corruption of power in the institutions of government and faith. There's never a happy ending, or never one that lasts from one book to the next.\n\nWhile I loved the immersive nature of Herbert's world, and appreciated the thoughts behind it, this book is a bit of a grind. There are chapters full of conversations that are so difficult to follow.

They are not very likable, or dislikable. They are just. There. Talking. So. Much. Many characters from the first book show up, and I was glad to see them as a reader, but I just wasn't invested in much of anything. I loved the atmosphere, but if a giant sandworm would have eaten the Atreides twins 100 pages in, I would have been very much not sad.\n\nThe plot picks up a few years after the last book. Paul's sister Alia is running a corrupted version of the cult of Muad'Dib on Arrakis. She's also been possessed by the inner ghost of Baron Harkonnen (there's those mystical shenanigans again!), and as a result is also in the only storyline I found very interesting. Jessica has been living off-world for some time, but returns to Arrakis on a mysterious mission from the Bene Gesserit. The twins are weird and make everyone uncomfortable, and Leto II has this plan for the future called The Golden Path which he will simultaneously not shut up about while never explaining what in the Hell it is. And there is a plot by the Corrino's to get back in power. So much plotting in this book, and so many conversations about plotting and thinking about plotting and counter-plotting. It was hard at times to figure out exactly what the purpose of some of the schemes were, other than to exist. Honestly, it probably didn't help that I would occasionally find myself zoned out mid-paragraph.\n\nAm I too stupid to get this book? Yes, that is completely possible. The philosophical ideas are sometimes interesting and Herbert's world is so immersive I don't feel right giving this less than 3 stars. In between the inner and outer monologues, I really enjoyed the further world-building. I can't even say whether I recommend it or not. If you can't get enough Dune (and I wouldn't blame you if you couldn't), you can continue with this book, but you may not feel the magic of the original.\n\nHaving read a synopsis of God Emperor, I'm not sure I'll ever tackle that one. Leto babbling about his stupid Golden Path for several millenia. I think the point of this series' later volumes may be that Gods are boring af.\n\nETA: Got a shouty complaint that there were spoilers in this review with no specifics.

And also, you have have changed as well.\n\nTen years later and I have read all of Herbert's original six and many of the books about the Dune universe written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. I've seen the 1984 film and the 2003 Children of Dune mini-series and am an overall fan of Dune.\n\nI'm not sure why I didn't like it more back then but I sure do now.\n\nHerbert's intricate attention to detail and his brilliantly complex characterization and dialogue, as well as his internal monologues are science fiction gold.\n\nThe interactions between The Preacher and the rest of the cast and Leto's beginning transformation, providing a foreshadowing of the next book, God Emperor of Dune, was a pleasure to read.\n\n******\n\nThe third of the and the slide away from the quality of the original masterpiece has begun in earnest.\n\nBetter than , but only in that it is more ambitious and with a more cohesive plot. Herbert takes a more introspective narrative to prepare the way for Leto II. The concepts of shared DNA, collective memories and possession run astride a vehicle of rapid autocratic decline.\n\nSome cool scenes, a few interesting new concepts, but ultimately Herbert's vision is starting to fray and the great bulk of his masterwork is becoming as cumbersome as the Baron's ghost.\n\nA cautionary tale for creators of series - go back to the well too often and the water gets stale."}, {"label": "negative", "text": ""}, {"label": "positive", "text": "Buddy read with Athena!\n\n\u201dThis rocky shrine to the skull of a ruler grants no prayers. It has become the grave of lamentations. Only the wind hears the voice of this place. The cries of night creatures and the passing wonder of two moons, all say his day has ended. No more supplicants come. The visitors have gone from the feast. How bare the pathway down this mountain.\n\nPaul Muad\u2019dib, god and emperor of a universe divided, is gone. The religiously pantocratic Imperium has been left with his two nine-year old children, Leto and Ghanima. But despite being born with the knowledge and memories of a thousand generations, the two Children of Dune will not be allowed to take their father\u2019s throne at such a young age. Instead the Atreides empire is ruled by a council of advisors, among them Stilgar and Irulan. But true power rests in the hands of Muad\u2019dib\u2019s sister, Alia Atreides, who clings to control of the regency.\n\nBut in Alia\u2019s mind there are voices whispering. The voices of evils long gone, who intend to forge the woman worshipped as the Womb of Heaven into a dangerous weapon to be unleashed. And while Alia descends into madness, House Corrino sees its chance to take back all that the Atreides have stolen from it. And a mysterious old Preacher walks out of the sands to publicly denounce the religion of Muad\u2019dib. Meanwhile, Leto and Ghanima journey together into the desert, chasing old myths and desperately trying to understand why the legendary sandworms are slowly disappearing from the surface of Dune\u2026\n\n\n\nOne very interesting aspect about the book, is the fact that it\u2019s filled to the brim with quotes about politics, religion and power. Just as is it a science fiction classic and an epic adventure, is something of a guidebook to the very meaning of power. Of how one struggles for it, how one gains it, and what absolute power can do to the person wielding it. And some of these lines would be worth quoting over and over.\n\n\n\nWhile not as outright astonishing as the first two books in the series, this is definitely a great addition to the wonderful universe of Dune. Frank Herbert\u2019s writing is better than ever, which is the reason for all the quotes in this review. And while certain characters are absent from this book, other character who were absent in are brought back onto the scene.\n\nThe part of the book that fascinated me the most was definitely the character development of Alia Atreides. When reading Dune, it's quite easy to notice that elements of it have directly inspired a lot of later fantasy authors, including Robert Jordan and George R.R. Martin. And there are many things of Alia, her rule as regent and her descent into madness that are particularly reminiscent of a certain queen named Cersei. But in my eyes, Alia is a more fascinating character still.\n\nThus ends the final book of the Great Dune Trilogy, one of the absolute greatest series every written within the genres of speculative fiction. But the tale goes on; a tale of spice and sandworms, of assassins and great houses, of the calculating Mentats and the devious plans of the Bene Gesserit; a tale of the planet Dune."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "In Children of Dune, we learn of the destinies of Paul Atreides-Muad'dib's two children, the two pre-born Ghanima and Leto and the tyranny of their Aunt Alia. I found the story to be beautifully written and the action kept the pace throughout. The appearance of the Preacher was interesting (if the identity was somewhat predictable) and I liked all the intrigue with the would-be usurper and his particularly out of control mother and their plots against the Atreides twins. The Golden Path which will drive the last three official Dune books is introduced here but only explained in God Emperor as we see the bizarre fate to which Leto II voluntarily succumbs.\n\nThere is quite a bit of philosophy here (and even more in the next books it seems) and lots of reflections about religious fanaticism as most everybody detests Alia and she loses this reader's sympathies when the extent of her Abomination is revealed. Against this backdrop is the loss of tradition for the Fremen as Dune is terraformed and the old ways of life pass away. This is even more intense in God Emperor, but it is touching here as well.\n\nThe thing that many take exception to is the ghola of Duncan Idaho. I think he is a fun character and obviously Frank Herbert, having killed off his Ned Stark early in Dune as well as his Robb Stark in Dune Messiah, wanted to keep his Jorah Mormont alive throughout the series if you allow me to abuse the Game of Thrones analogies. Actually, there are more similarities than that: the span of time that Dune's alternative history covers is as long and complex as that of RR Martin. The male-centric point of view, disdain for homosexual relationships, and fascination with incest is also a commonality. Lastly, although Frank had the excuse of dying before writing #7, Martin apparently may never get around to writing #6 Winds of War or #7 A Dream of Spring leaving us (and the Targaryans, Lannisters and remaining Starks eternally hanging!)\n\nThe ending was spectacular - perhaps the best ending in a Dune book as far as I have read them (reading Heretics of Dune now) with the palace scene and the Leto II cliffhanger. I am definitely glad that I persevered this far in the Dune series and found this was a particularly strong entry.\n\n[UPDATE] I am looking forward to Denis Villeneuve's Dune in October 2021. The previews I have seen so far seem to be quite coherent with respect to the book. I was a fan of Lynch's Dune and am curious to see what Villeneuve does with this one.

This one focuses on the children of Muad'Dib, as well as his sister Alia, wife-in-name-only Irulan, and the return of his mother Jessica to the political goings-on of Arrakis and the struggles with the almost cult-like religion that has sprung up around his supposed death and his sister as its new figurehead.

Muad'Dib) has walked off into the desert after achieving prescience; he is presumed dead. His sister Alia now rules the Imperium. Waiting in the wings to become the next Emperor is the young Leto II, Paul's son. Young Leto II and his sister Ghanima are \"pre-born\", meaning their personalities were fully formed in the womb. They carry the memories, and, it seems, the personalities, of their entire ancestral line in their minds. This gives them the wisdom and knowledge of many lives and countless centuries, so they are effectively mature adults in the bodies of children.\n\nIn this new post-Paul Imperium, Alia's grasp on power is tenuous at best. The mysterious Bene Gesserit continue to plot in the shadows, attempting to maintain their long-developed breeding program, which had seemingly already met its goal of producing a Kwisatz Haderach with Paul Atreides. Can Alia hold on to power? Will Leto II rise to become Emperor? What really happened to Paul Atreides? And who is The Preacher, the mysterious man who has been speaking heresy against Alia's empire and spreading dissent across the galaxy?\n\nThere is a lot to like in . It's beautifully, at times lyrically written. It's like reading a work of art in prose. Some of the best Dune characters return in Duncan Idaho, Gurney Halleck, and Stilgar, but there is also an interesting cast of new characters, like Prince Farad'n Corrino, Leto II, and Ghanima. I also really liked the exploration of the ecological transformation of the planet Arrakis (Dune), which in this book is rapidly transforming from an arid desert world into one with rain and vegetation, a transformation that comes with powerful economic and sociological consequences. The ending was also enjoyable, though it left much unanswered.\n\nThat being said, I think the Dune Chronicles are starting to wear on me a bit. The books are all basically the same, and it's becoming a bit tiring. Each book is built using a predictable formula of palace intrigue, a confusing plot that raises more questions than it ever answers (even by its conclusion) and that frustratingly keeps the reader always in the dark, the bizarre and futile plotting of the Bene Gesserit witches, which begins to appear more pathetic every book that goes by, power struggles, doubletalk thoughts and ruminations that add no value to the story and are just plain boring, etc.\n\nThis particular entry was absolutely with doubletalk, or what I call \"word soup\". Probably about half of this book was made up of these boring, confusing, and seemingly meaningless thoughts and reflections about time, life, consciousness, and other such topics. I normally love a good dialogue about such thought-provoking subjects, but it just didn't work here. Even the characters were confused in this book! There were numerous scenes in the book where a character openly admitted they had no idea what was going on.\n\nAs a character in a Dune book, anyone could be your enemy, even your own family members. Everything must be questioned, every assertion doubted. Secret plots abound everywhere, most of which are never explained to the reader, or even understood by the other characters. Sound like fun? Maybe for a few books, but there are books in the Dune Chronicles, and after a while it becomes a bit tedious. This feels like a classic case of an author stretching something that would have worked really well as one or two books into something that doesn't really work very well as six longer books.\n\nI can't say I'm excited to read the next book in the series at this point, which makes me really sad, because I loved and . I'll probably put the Dune Chronicles down for a little while, or, perhaps more likely, for a longer while...\n\n3.5 stars"}, {"label": "positive", "text": "I've always held that it's impossible to compare the Dune sequels to the first book but it would be insane to say that they're anything less than excellent in their own right.\n\nIt doesn't even matter to me that this particular book was nommed for the Hugo in '77. The fact that we get much more of a look into the hearts and minds of the Fremen, watch the tragedy of Alia unfold with the help of her maternal grandfather, and uncover the secret of the wandering Preacher shouldn't make much of a difference, but it does.\n\nJessica's transformation is something else. I particularly liked when she became a teacher and when she toyed with her own Gom Jabbar.\n\nBut the true stars of this book have got to be the twins. Leto and Ghanima are something special. Almost abominations like their aunt, they both walk a knife's edge and Leto leads the way. She's his rock, but Leto's ultimate choice to follow the Golden Path is ultimately only his to walk.\n\nMirroring Leto with Paul was amazing in the story. The focus on timelines either forking or narrowing down as more and more choices are made really illustrated how prescience is the ultimate trap. Paul absolutely fell into it, but one could make the argument that Leto's choice is the true tragedy.\n\nA TOTALLY awesome tragedy, mind you, with tons of benefits and an even more explosive benefit for the human race to come -- (this is COMPLETELY debatable) -- but it's still a mind experiment and worldbuilding masterpiece that has continued to haunt me since the first time I read it in the late '80s to this very day.\n\nAn excellent SF?

\"More Herbie! For the love of Shai-Hulud, give me more!\"\nAt worst, you'll feel as though you've just emerged from a private rendezvous in the Baron's chambers and wish for nothing more than your flesh to be enveloped in sandtrout membrane so you never have to experience anything like it again.\n\nThis is not just my personal opinion, it\u2019s been proven. Proven by the broad range of community ratings and reviews; proven, in practice, to me through the wildly varying results of my buddy-read with the always lovely Sister Adina and Nastya-Hulud. A DNF 1-star, a 4 star and another yet to be seen.\nIf you\u2019re to have a good time with this entry, it seems to me you\u2019ll have to approach it with a healthy reserve of good grace for ol\u2019 Herb, likely accrued from the first book! Luckily, I still had an abundance of this, even after the slightly sketchy \u2018Messiah\u2019 left me with a few concerning scruples.\n\nFact is, . Puzzling character motives, inconsistent personal morals/characteristics and seemingly important character arcs/story elements that never eventuate to anything largely due to the dominating nature of Leto2\u2019s path. The characters are, across the board, unrelatable. In some cases, intellectually superior to the point that they are hardly human and, in others, no longer human at all and with a level of prescience that our puny minds could never fathom. It can also be difficult to correlate the Galactic-scale implications of the decisions being made by these now God-like characters with the rather small setting in which it all plays out; The Dune Universe (our Universe) never quite feels as big as we are told it is.\n\n, in almost all cases, somehow, I was able to unabashedly, and unapologetically put on my critical blindfold, hold my white cane out in faux ignorance and conjure up some meagre but plausible reason why this non-sensical thing occurred or why this person made such an uncharacteristic decision\u2026 Almost.Every.Time!! It was as though I, myself, had become abomination and the inner voice of Frank Herbert had conquered, possessed, and convinced me that this was the greatest thing ever! Hell, it just occurred to me that I might not even be the author of this review!\n\nFor one thing, it is , man! Herbs is not afraid to let his freak flag fly and my enjoyment may partly be attributed to this freak show factor. Be it Alia the abomination with a sublimely grotesque selection of inner-voice in the Baron Harkonnen; Leto2\u2019s transformation from Ancient boy-man to Sand trout (controlled-state Abomination) Demi-God; the still unshakeable eeriness of Ghola Idaho\u2026 The list of bizarro elements goes on and on and, frankly, I could not get enough of the slightly sinister and off-putting wrongness of it all.\n\nI loved everything related to the pre-borns: The totality of genetic memory and the battle against these inner voices; the threat of abomination. Leto2\u2019s arc to the \u2018Golden Path\u2019 and how his trajectory crossed that of his father, \u201cthe Preacher\u201d! And how about that crystal-clear depiction of his forced Spice trance. The manageable but progressively more elusive blend of Metaphysics, philosophy, theology, and ecology that it all entailed, staggering! Character dialogue: the way Herbert consistently creates tension between characters through both their internal processes and the perpetual suspicion that one or more characters, at any time, are being subliminally maneuvered, sublime!\n\nIf I didn\u2019t have other priorities, I\u2019d open up the next one right away but, regardless, I\u2019ll be back to finish off the final 3 at some point!\nMany thanks to Nastya and Adina of the Buddy-Gesserit for joining me and consolidating some of my own thoughts while offering some welcome alternatives along the way."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "Takie ksi\u0105\u017cki s\u0105 niezwykle potrzebne, bo po ich przeczytaniu orientujecie si\u0119, \u017ce wasze \u017cycia s\u0105 ca\u0142kiem normalne, a kartk\u00f3wka z trygonometrii, kt\u00f3ra facetka zapowiedzia\u0142a na nast\u0119pny tydzie\u0144, nie wydaje si\u0119 ju\u017c taka straszna.\nDobrze, \u017ce jestem z ma\u0142opolski, a nie Arrakis.\n\nO, a to film o Diunie:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0sPw..."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "I'm very much looking forward to Villeneuve's interpretation of Dune that will be shown in theaters this year so I decided to not only read the original book but also the rest of the series.\n\nNine years have passed since the end of book #2 and the twins have grown, protected by Stilgar and others still loyal to Muad'Dib. Or are they? Every single one of them seems to be unsure.\nLiet Kynes, Chani's father and thus the twins' maternal grandfather, always dreamed of Arrakis becoming a green planet full of life ... interesting considering he was an ecologist and should have known the kind of death that would bring. Now, his dream seems to be coming true more and more - with dangerous consequences.\nThanks to the Melange/Spice addiction in the family, the twins have genetic memory so they aren't just children. Consequently, they already sit in the council chamber with their aunt Alia and others, ruling the empire.\nPart of the known universe has fallen in with the religious mania about the cult surrounding the Atreidis heir who became the messiah, while the other part of the universe strictly rejects this kind of madness and is still plotting to wrestle power back.\nOn top of the threats from without (the Corrinos, the Bene Gesserit, the \"preacher\", \u2026), there is the threat from within. Because interestingly, confusingly, the Atreidis family is kinda falling apart. For example,\n\n(I will freely admit that I did NOT enjoy that part and it made me dislike\na lot). Jessica was an actual disappointment. I felt almost as if she was no longer the Jessica we knew from the previous book(s) and I really didn\u2019t like her trying to split up the twins, her judgment and that she had gotten so stupid.\n\n- Ghanima is definitely right about that one as her father is proof.\n- Leto II\n\nThere were quite some big surprises for me, one being that the twins have red hair! *lol* Yes, I'm influenced by the mini series .\nBut there was also the revelation that the Fremen are NOT native to Arrakis and migrated there (Arrakis, in fact, seems to be the 5th planet they migrated to).\nThe biggest, however, was that the sandtrouts, the fore-form (larva) of the sandworms, do not originate on Arrakis either! That revelation led to us learning in even greater detail of the ecology and biology of the planet as well as of the process that creates Melange/Spice.\n\nOnce again, I enjoyed the exploration of the Spice addiction, that it is indeed called an addiction, and that we see not only the positive effects but also the dark side.\n\nThis volume is another coming-of-age story, albeit a bit different from the one describing Paul growing up. The twins are even younger here than Paul was in the first book and just like his father, Let II too, has to grow up too fast and learn to use these crushing powers. How he does it, however, is quite different.\nYou see, thanks to their powers, both Paul and Leto II see timelines either branching out or narrowing down, which intensifies as more and more choices are made, and that really showed how such god-like powers are nothing but a trap. A trap that Paul coulnd\u2019t escape but Leto II did.\nOr is it the other way around? That really IS debatable.\nLeto\u2019s early wisdom and willpower also made for some highly entertaining encounters - especially the one with his grandmother. *lol*\nWhat was quite disorienting, however, was how most characters evolved\n. Heartbreaking in and of itself.\n\nPlans within plans, some caught within the machinations, one intrigue after another, arranged family loyalties / marriages, the return of one of the best literary villains ever. It made for a tense reading experience indeed (not least because of my investment regarding some of the characters).\n\n\nThe final confrontation was ... epic. There is no other word for it.

Herbert completely discarded novel writing in favor of writing his philosophical musings about power. Yet his ideas are in the vacuum, completely separated from human nature and believable consequences for people who are ouside of the selected few. For example, we have a great house who wants the power of the emperor back, yet the biggest dilemma of the character in question is does he want to sacrifice his hobbies of reading books and studying to become an emperor. And then it\u2019s just mentioned that at the moment the guy rules the whole planet. How? What do people think about it?

I really enjoyed the first two and was eager to jump in. Herbert has strengths but more weaknesses as a writer. The world of mysticism and political brinksmanship that he deftly fosters is often blunted by flat story telling. Dune itself is a fantastic book but the storytelling suffered with too many POVs that crashed over one another as well as mysticism itself serving as both plot device and resolution which doesn't really work.\n\nI was really engaged in the first half. I loved discovering the new characters and how the old characters fit into new developments. Lady Jessica, Alia, Duncan and the rest as well as the Preacher--all great characters with tons of political intrigue. Arrakis itself has undergone a good bit of development which is fascinating to read.\n\nThe crux of the plot is based on such an intangible timeline that it kind of feels futile to even pay attention to.

Fortunately it only appears once but Mr. Herbert still sneaks in the odd snippet here and there whenever I am feeling too complacent.\n\nTo my mind the Dune series really finishes with this third volume. It ties up all the loose ends nicely and ends on an optimistic and suitably poignant note. Come to think of it the very first Dune novel feels very complete within itself, and you could read it as one of the greatest standalone sci-fi novels of all time (or one of the most overrated if it doesn\u2019t do it for you).\n\nSo the Atreides are at it again with their mystical shenanigan. These Atreides are so damn verbose 24/7, I swear none of them is capable of speaking like a normal person. I can not imagine how they say \u201cpass the salt\u201d at dinner without mentioning the cosmic ramifications should the salt passing project not be successfully concluded. That said is actually quite an entertaining read, much more so than which often had a soporific effect on me when I was reading it. focuses on the two Atreides kids, Leto and Ghanima (or non-kids because their heads are stuffed full of their ancestors\u2019 memories and it makes them super weird). Their father, the legendary Paul Atreides A.K.A. Muad\u2019Dib walked off into the sunset of the Arrakis desert nine years ago, very pissed off about what the world has come to thanks to his leadership. He is now presumed dead as the Dune desert is deadly and not conducive to a pleasant stroll after dinner.\n\nThe planet Arrakis has come a long way since we first encountered it in the terraforming project is going well and water is more abundant with plants appearing in some areas, other areas of the global desert is becoming moist. Rains and clouds are often seen and early in the novel eight Fremen drown in a flashflood. When you have a culture based on the scarcity of water this development really turns the world upside down. The cultural and social ramifications of Arrakis becoming more watery are the most fascinating aspect of the book for me.\n\nThe book starts off slowly (as most books do) with the introduction of the Atreides twins and ambles along pleasantly enough. At almost exactly the half way point Mr. Herbert suddenly shifts gears and the novel becomes much more plot intensive and relatively fast paced. Exciting things are certainly afoot in the second half the the novel; featuring a murder plot involving tigers, a possession that makes you fat, the birth of a sort of Duneman superhero and many spoilerish things that I won\u2019t mention (probably said too much already \u2013 sorry!).\n\nAll in all a fun read, there is plenty of subtexts and philosophy to think about if you want to (I had my brain switched off, it\u2019s my standard mode). The theme of religion and fanaticism is ever present. I don\u2019t know if I will go on to read and the subsequent volumes.

Meanwhile, their aunt Alia, now the true ruler of the empire, wanted to use the twin for her own ends but in secret she also struggled to handle the 'voices' of her ancestors within herself.\n\nThen the twin's grandmother, Lady Jessica, returned to Arrakis (a place she lost her Duke, Leto I) to visit her daughter and grandchildren, but soon power struggle within the court, conflicts among different religion groups and the Fremen tribes threatened to throw everything off balance, whilst a mysterious Preacher (who was believed by many to be Paul Atreides himself) became popular among the people and the twin realized the desert and the sandworms, and in turn the Fremen's old way of life, were threatened by the terraformation the planet Arrakis had undergone through decades.\n\nI read the Chinese translation of this book, some parts of this novel are a bit dry and the many characters and their relationships are a bit hard to follow at times but overall all the court's intrigues are a delight to read (yes I view this book as a court's intrigues fantasy wrapped in a Sci-Fi wrapping)\n\nIt's also delightful to see all the power struggles going on among the different factions and I like Mr. Herbert's insight of how good intention might not come up with good results and his intention to break up the messiah myth around the main character of the first two books, Paul Atreides. In fact, as Paul's children Leto and Ghanima struggled to right their father's mistakes and Leto\n, it is made quite clear that blind faith and promoting a mortal to the height of godhood had done more harm to the world than good.\n\nThe scene with the twin going into the desert is also well written.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't think I like Alia's story and its conclusion, she doesn't have much room to develop excepts being a victim to madness and the typical bad ruler --although at the back of my mind I am not entirely sure Alia is intended to be put up as an example of a bad ruler, since most of her opponents aren't any more merciful and righteous than she."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "Children of Dune (Dune #3), Frank Herbert\nChildren of Dune is a 1976 science fiction novel by Frank Herbert, the third in his Dune series of six novels. At the end of Dune Messiah, Paul Atreides walks into the desert, a blind man, leaving his twin children Leto and Ghanima in the care of the Fremen, while his sister Alia rules the universe as regent. Awakened in the womb by the spice, the children are the heirs to Paul's prescient vision of the fate of the universe, a role that Alia desperately craves. House Corrino schemes to return to the throne, while the Bene Gesserit make common cause with the Tleilaxu and Spacing Guild to gain control of the spice and the children of Paul Atreides.

Herbert, that is. His science fiction universe has come to embody everything that another seminal epic of our time, \u201cStar Wars,\u201d cannot: subtlety and mystery. \u201cChildren of Dune\u201d is the third installment in the series and centers on the vicissitudes of a power struggle involving Paul Atreides\u2019 sister and his children. This in a vacuum created by Muad\u2019Dib since his disappearance into the desert at the end of the second novel, \u201cDune Messiah.\u201d\n\nArrakis will ever be the story\u2019s home, but the increasing excursions made to other worlds like Salusa Secundus and Tleilax whet our appetite for myriad unexplored corners of this galaxy. That is to say: Herbert\u2019s universe is even larger than ever. He is the anti-Lucas because to experience the world of Dune is to live in the thought-bubbles of its characters, constantly reading one another\u2019s expressions, trying desperately to interpret nonverbal cues of zen-like figures like mentats and Bene Gesserit \u201cwitches,\u201d wherein plots and schemes and indignation (the silent kind) abound. Noticeably absent are staccato, declarative descriptions of landscape, weaponry, technology, conflict, combat, or physical features and their like. Conversation and thought are the rivulets that feed every facet of the \u201cDune\u201d universe, and that universe seems even larger because of the vast expanses unmentioned.\n\nTake, for example, the Lady Jessica\u2019s travels to Salusa Secundus, a rare deviation from the political plotting and religious fervor of Arrakis. We are treated to none of the tired and typical expositions expected. We are not told how Salusa looks from space; what the travel involved to reach it; how many people live there; what differentiates its character from other worlds; its climate; its people; its proximity to Arrakis; its size; what city Jessica is in; we are not privy to innumerable things, rather getting to unpack it all under the auspices of our own imaginings. As a result, \u201cChildren of Dune\u201d expands the Dune universe by an order of magnitude. I cannot help contradistinguishing this incredible style to the mundane plodding to which it might have easily fallen prey in more ordinary hands.\n\nTo say much of the plot of \u201cChildren of Dune\u201d is to drain it of a beauty and mystery exclusive to your own mind\u2019s eye. Its protagonists (admittedly not wholly protagonistic) are nine year-olds. They function with physical and mental prowess that could never be translated to the silver or small screens, and thus they belong entirely to you, to be made your own, as much as Arrakis and Salusa and Tleilax are yours.

I remembered more than I thought I would. I hate what has happened to Paul but enjoying the twins. Alia has gone hill! I loved her in Dune but not now. Jessica is also horrible! What happened to the great characters? Ugh!\nI enjoyed the story regardless!"}, {"label": "neutral", "text": "Children of Dune\nBook 3 of the Dune Chronicles\nBy Frank Herbert\n\nA Dune Retrospective by Eric Allen.\n\nThis book is a bit of a hard one for me to rate, because parts of it are so good, while others are so not. Everyone likes to say that is a bridge between the events of and Children of Dune. However, most people do not realize two things about this series. First was that Herbert meant to stop after Dune Messiah. And Second, when he finally decided he had more story to tell, seven years had passed. Looking at the series as a whole, now, it seems that way to some people, but at the time that these books were published, it was not the case. Dune Messiah was meant to be the end, not a bridge of any sort between better books in the series.\n\nChildren of Dune follows many swirling plots throughout the empire to remove the titular Children from their places as heirs to Paul \"Muad'dib\" Atreides. His sister Alia has become possessed by the old Baron Harkonen, and is actively trying to bring the monarchy down and take power for herself. The heir to house Corino is plotting to take the throne in other ways. The Bene Gesserit have their own plots, as do the Spacing Guild, and a hundred other people or groups.\n\nIn the midst of all of the chaos and plotting, a blind preacher appears out of the desert, calling down the religion that worships Paul as a god, and preching defiance of Alia, and a return to Fremen tradition. Many think that he is Muad'dib returned to them from the desert where he wandered off to die, but many question why he would return only to tear down the religion and empire that he, himself, built.\n\nThe twin Atreides heirs plan... something, and in carrying out their plans accomplish... something, but the book never really bothers to tell us what, so it's probably not all that important.\n\nEverything comes together when all plots fail, and young Leto assumes the throne after doing... something, which allows him to do so... for some reason... I guess, bringing about changes that will change the face of Arrakis for a time, bringing a storm through the known universe, but which will result in peaceful calm once it is through.\n\nThe Good? There is a lot to like in this book. The political intrigues, all the back dealing, and plotting, and maneuvering are really well done and play out to a wonderful conclusion. There's a lot of real tension through many scenes as various factions play off each other for control of Arrakis, the spice, and the empire. Alia's fall into insanity is really well played out, and she makes a very good villain. The story is epic in scope, much like the first book, encomassing huge changes in the empire, and there are a lot of great character interactions throughout the novel.\n\nThe Bad? The twins are, frankly, not characters. Hell, they're barely even plot devices. They're not even that, they're more like stage props. They have absolutely no personality of their own. Their motivations are, for the most part, a complete mystery to the reader. They just... do things, without explanation of why, or how, or why it's important to the plot. They don't act like real people. They merely exist within the plot to facilitate the needs of the story and for no other reason. AND HALF OF THE ENTIRE BOOK IS FROM THEIR POINTS OF VIEW!!!\n\nThe twins are creepy, and weird, and say and do things that just make no sense, because they have no context, because the author couldn't bother himself to give us one. For example, there's one part where the twins, who have access to the memories of all their ancestors, \"play the mother father game\" wherein they take on the persona, from those memories, of their parents... for some reason. And this serves some purpose... I guess. Now, I could see if they were curious about the parents that they never met, and wanted to know more about them. But that would require them to show something resembling human emotion, or motivation, two things that they do not appear to have. They constantly complain about being treated as children, and constantly show themselves by their behavior to BE children. And that is the extent of their personalities, and the vast majority of their dialog in the book.\n\nWhen the main protagonists of the story are so lifeless and devoid of personality that they are basically only props wheeled out when the plot needs something to happen involving them, it's very hard to care. Any tension and drama revolving around the twins is completely meaningless, because they're not characters. They don't act like real people. They have no personality or motivation. So why should I care when they are in danger, or when a big choice is placed before them that could impact the entire empire... for some reason? I don't, because Herbert failed to realize that just because these are Paul's children, does not automatically mean that I care about them. They are not developed as characters at all, and because of that, each and every scene that they appear in is awkward and creepy, and all tension revolving around them is non-existent. If you want me to care about your characters, you need to treat them with a little more care than you do the scenery, and expounding upon their motivations and plans even just to the point of showing that they even HAVE motivations and plans would go a long way toward making them sympathetic. I mean, all I'm asking for is a paragraph here and there that makes these children feel like real people, with real emotions and motivations, and plans that aren't completely left to my imagination. Is that so much to ask? I mean, I'm the reader here, not the writer. I'm not supposed to be filling these things in myself. That's the writer's job, and he failed spectacularly to do it.\n\nAll the epic events in the universe, frankly, become boring and a chore to read through when the people at the center of everything have to take twelve steps up just to be considered wooden. When you have no connection to the characters, the story itself becomes meaningless and dull.\n\nIn conclusion, while this book does have some MASSIVE flaws in the characters and their motivations, it is still an exciting book full of some very excellent political plotting and intrigues, as well as inner turmoil within the empire. Alia slowly going insane and power hungry is really well done, and the Preacher wandering out of the desert to try and right the wrongs that were done in the name of Muad'Dib gives a really interesting view on the way mob mentality and religion sometimes go hand in hand for the worst possible outcome. There's a lot to enjoy in this book, but on the other hand, there's a lot that's hard to get through, and so I can only give this book three stars. It was far from a horrible book, but at the same time, the main protagonists don't even qualify as plot devices most of the time, so it's also far from a great book. It was merely ok. I just felt that, being the followup to two such well crafted stories with a strong central protagonist, this book was a little weak with the lack of one.\n\nP.S.

read it. Hated every person in it, did not understand why anyone acted the way they did. Now it's one of my top-ten comfort reads, and I see so much in Leto I want for myself.\n\nDune was the perfect hero book, and then Herbert turned the trope of \u201cboy becomes Messiah and saves the noble people\u201d on its head with Dune Messiah and Children of Dune. In those two volumes, everything assumed and trusted became so much sand, and a son had to destroy his Messiah father\u2019s legacy to save the universe from religious genocide and tyranny. We closed on the boy becoming yet another saviour and had only a vague, hopeful idea of what he intended to do next.\n\nHerbert could have left us there, many thought he would when he finished his Dune Trilogy. Instead, he published his most difficult and daring book yet. In Emperor, we discover that the boy\u2019s plan to save humanity from tyranny is... to become the ultimate Tyrant, and Predator of humankind. Yeah, I\u2019m with you. Just say \u201chuh?\u201d and get it over with. I can\u2019t explain without giving plot away. Emperor is a masterpiece of philosophy, and the best book in the series, but I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you stopped somewhere in the middle and stuffed it to the back of your shelf for ten years before you gave it another chance.

I\u2019m going to change everything and establish a revolution that will affect tens of billions of people and then when that\u2019s done, I\u2019m going to be a prophet of what went wrong and institute a theological framework for the continuation of our rule.\n\nLeto II: Hold my beer.\n\nThis is the greatest reversal of opinion about a book I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nThere\u2019s an old saying about how you can never step twice into the same river, because both you and the river have changed. Wonder if that\u2019s what happened here. I reviewed this in 2011, giving it a two star, and taking a break from the Dune series and even from Frank Herbert for over three years. In the past ten years, I\u2019ve grown more comfortable with my love of all things Dune, and maybe matured some in my appreciation of fantasy literature.\n\nI\u2019ve reread Dune several times, reread Dune Messiah a couple years ago and then Children of Dune this year, enjoying Herbert\u2019s writing more and more. As I turned the last page on Children, as Leto is demonstrating his superhuman powers, I looked ahead knowing that I had rung up a 2-star rating on the next book.\n\nCritics of God Emperor, and I was one, compare this to the original, even lamenting the absurdity of Leto\u2019s transformation into a near worm. Herbert was too good for such a continuation; in Leto he crafted a character unique in SF literature.\n\nLeto as Superman.\n\nAs great a character as Superman is in the DC universe, and in our superhero mythos over the past 80 years, becoming an iconic image of all things symbolizing truth, justice and the American way, critics have correctly lampooned that he\u2019s too perfect, god-like in his power and invulnerability. Garth Ennis, in his brilliant anti-hero satire The Boys, made up Homelander, a hero much like Clark Kent except he is twisted to evil. Ennis poses the delicious question, if superman is bad, what are you going to do?\n\nAs Children of Dune ends, Leto has become a symbiosis of man and sand trout, becoming something else. He demonstrates his new powers to the Fremen, revealing that he is inhumanly strong and seemingly invincible.\n\nHold my beer.\n\nMore than three thousand years later and he has transformed the known universe as completely as his appearance. He is a massive creature, more worm than man, and possibly immortal. THREE THOUSAND AND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS. It would be like if an Egyptian pharaoh began to rule in 1500 BCE and is still in power! All the world a vassal under his sandaled feet.\n\nHerbert describes the Pax Leto, an enforced tranquility where Leto is worshipped as a god, supreme in his power and influence.\n\nAnd here is where Herbert demonstrates his genius: this is a character study, a glimpse into ultimate power. The galaxy is ruled by the iron hand of a single entity, a thing who is both man and woman and neither, having a complete recall of millennia of collective memories and a prescience of future events.\n\nThere is a scene where Leto discusses with one of his most trusted servants about how the man, already elderly, is a mote in the god Leto\u2019s eye, his long life a mere speck in the measurement of a being who had lived more than thirty times as long and without a definite life span ahead.\n\n\u201cWhoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you.\u201d\n\nHerbert, the Science Fiction Hall of Fame member, and winner of the Nebula and Hugo awards, then reveals in Leto a lost humanity. He laments his lost manhood and weeps for love and intimacy that he can never realize.\n\nLeto and Duncan Idaho.\n\nWhen I first read this over ten years ago, I found some comic relief in the endless parade of Duncan Idaho ghola clones who came to serve Leto from the axolotl tanks of the Ixians. When one Duncan dies, usually at the hands of Leto, his replacement arrives soon thereafter, recalling his death in the pages of the original Dune and not understanding the world in which he lives nor the master he now serves. This time around I see that Herbert uses Duncan not just as a tie in to the earlier story, but as a grounding vehicle for Leto, Duncan is his connection to his humanity, and from the perspective of as voyeur his surrogate.\n\nDuncan\u2019s relationship with Hwi Noree is all the more poignant when considering this odd love triangle.\n\nLeto and The Worm.\n\nMany characters in the book note that Leto is a composite of man and worm, even distinguishing behavior associated with Leto and other, more bestial and unpredictable and dangerous, as that of the worm as apex predator. In this way Herbert evokes the duality of man allusion from Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s Jekyll and Hide. Stephen King noted, in Danse Macabre, that Stevenson\u2019s 1886 work was a fundamental template upon which much of the horror genre was based. Storylines and themes as divergent as werewolves and The Incredible Hulk all share horrific foundations of man and monster, of man losing control of the thin veneer of civilization to quickly and irrevocably become beast. In Leto, Herbert has envisioned the culmination of this concept \u2013 man to god, man to devil \u2013 and we can also consider an association with Arthur Machen\u2019s 1890 publication the Great God Pan as Leto is referred to as wild and threatening, a hulking killer.\n\nAnd of course a sand worm has special significance in Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune world building. Leto has become that time\u2019s Shai-Hulud.\n\nSo, my opinion of this great book has been radically changed. Not the weakest link in a great series, but a brilliant work in its own right."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "Bardzo si\u0119 ciesz\u0119, \u017ce jednak nie poprzesta\u0142am na przeczytaniu \"Diuny\".\n\"B\u00f3g Imperator Diuny\" jest inny.

This book is bad in a way that few things achieve. Oh, yes, there are worse things than this book in human history, and I do not mean to cheapen the horror of those atrocities, but when it comes to complete and utter failures in fictional exploits, this is amongst the worst.\n\nBy this time in his career, Frank Herbert's Dune series had sold multiple millions of books. He was a veritable gold mine for his publisher, and so, he had the power and influence to basically get anything he wanted from them. As a result, God Emperor of Dune is pure and complete insanity. Oh, but its not just normal insanity, oho no. Its a special sort of insanity. Its the sort of insanity that happens when you give crazy way too much money, power, influence, and creative license. I like to call this kind of crazy, George Lucas Syndrome.\n\nAllow me to explain. In 1977 George Lucas, a rookie filmmaker, under huge budget constraints, and with heavy studio influence, managed to produce one of the greatest movies of all time. Though Star Wars was well recieved by the world at large, his distributer still placed very harsh budget constraints on the following two films. These movies were a great illustration of the concept \"Art from Adversity\". Despite all of the people telling him no, all the limitations of special effects technology, all of the problems with budgeting and studio executives trying to change his work, he managed to produce one of the most lucrative franchises in movie history. He was viewed as a filmmaking genius by many... and then he made the prequels. He had unlimited funds, was no longer constrained by the limits of special effects technology, and most importantly, everyone on earth was utterly terrified to tell him no, because he could very easily take his goldmine of a series elsewhere and be just as happy. When you take the adversity, the thing that CLEARLY created the art to begin with, out of the picture, you are left with a man who is completely insane, making movies that are also completely insane.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Dune, you ask? Plenty. You see, having sold millions of copies of his first three books in the Dune series, Frank Herbert had enough clout with his publishers that he could have taken a dump on a blank piece of paper and they would have published it, because they were utterly terrified that he would take his series elsewhere. And so, when he handed them the manuscript for God Emperor of Dune, NO ONE SAID ANYTHING ABOUT HOW TERRIBLE IT WAS TO HIM!!! They published it because he wrote it, it had Dune in the title, and people would buy it, read it, and claim to love it because of it.\n\nSo, this leaves the question, was Herbert balls out insane from the beginning, and simply constrained by his publishers and editors to create art for his first three books? Or did he just do a crapton of drugs between book 3 and book 4? We may never know the answer for sure.\n\nWhy is this book so bad? Well, lets find out, shall we?\n\nI can't put enough quotation marks around the word \"story\" here, so I won't even try. 3500 years have passed since the events of . Leto Atreides II has become a giant sandworm with a human face and arms... Yeah, I'll give you a minute to wrap your mind around that. You good? Ok, moving on then. The ENTIRE plot of this book revolves around Leto talking, and talking, and talking, and talking, and talking, and talking, and talking. He talks about being a sandworm. He talks about what it means to be a sandworm. He talks about why it's important that he has become a sandworm. He talks about how being a sandworm fits into his plans. And through all that talking, HE NEVER MANAGES TO TALK ABOUT WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT TO THE PLOT OR WHY I SHOULD CARE!!! And then he dies, easily killed by his utter arrogance in believing that mere humans could never possibly rise up against him. And I get a lot of people telling me I've got it wrong on this... but try reading his last few bits of dialog after falling in the water with this in mind and tell me I don't have a point. If this was not what Herbert meant to convey with this dialog, he sure failed at what he actually meant to get across to me.\n\nThe Good? Nada. In fact, skip this book if you plan to read this series. Your life will be better for it. You miss absolutely nothing that the next book does not readily explain in a few sentences, and you don't have to wade through all the complete fail that this book embodies.\n\nThe Ugly? First of all, while Herbert's views on women were pretty apparent in his previous works, he is openly sexist in this book to a huge and offensive degree. He has some extraordinarily strange views on the roles women play in society, what they want out of life, and how their thoughts and feelings differ from those of men. He devotes a large section of the book to explaining in great detail why women are inferior to men, veiling it behind the guise of praising them as a gender. Nice try Herbert, but you FAIL to hide your complete contempt for women in general. Every woman that I know that has read this book has come away from it TERRIBLY offended. Women beware, this book basically says that you're the scum of the universe and the source of every problem that man knows. If this sort of thing offends you, and believe me, I'm a guy and it offends ME, steer clear of this book.\n\nNot only does Herbert put forward some very offensive ideas about women, he also puts forth some very offensive views about homosexuals, soldiers, and pretty much all humanity in general. Women get the worst of it here by far, but soldiers and homosexuals come close on their heels. He seems to have great contempt for pretty much anyone that is not exactly like he is. This is an actual line from the book. I have not altered it in any way. There are so many layers of offensiveness buried in those six little words that I could write an entire essay on that alone. Needless to say, it is offensive to every party mentioned in multiple ways. It takes true talent and bigotry to imbue such a short sentence with so many layers of insult to so many different people. And let me say right here and now, so that there is no mistaking Herbert's views for my own, though I may come from a strong Christian background, I have no problem with gay people. My philosophy on life is that everyone should have the freedom to live as they see fit, and it is not my place to tell them that they are doing it wrong, regardless of my own personal feelings on the matter. I have worked with gay people all my working life and you know what I've learned about them? They're people. Just like everyone else. Doing their best to live their lives in a world that is not very accepting of them. They deserve to live their lives just like everyone else.\n\nEvery character in this book other than Leto exists for one purpose and one purpose alone. To ask questions that facilitate even more talking from him. Let me describe to you every scene in this book. Leto rants for about thirty pages on his morality and plan for humanity. Someone is confused by his complete insanity and asks him a question. He then goes on at great length explaining the answer. The other character is still confused and asks another question, which facilitates yet another long and boring rant from him. These characters have no personality. They have no motivation. They have no plans or desires of their own. They exist within the plot for one purpose and one purpose only, to give Leto an excuse to further explain Frank Herbert's insanity.\n\nLeto is still not a sympathetic character. He has more personality here than he did in the previous book, this is true, but here he is even more loathsome because of it. I'm sorry, I do not sympathize with a grotesque mockery of humanity who goes on, and on, and on, and on about he's the only hope of said humanity, and as such has the right to severly subjugate all life in the universe under his strictures and rule. He was not a likeable character to begin with, and here, he has become a loathsome tyrant that it is impossible to sympathize with. So why should I care about a book that is, primarily, about him talking at GREAT LENGTH about his own personal philosophy? I don't. I really, REALLY don't. He's a terrible character, and as an extension of that, any story revolving around him is also terrible.\n\nHerbert STILL does not seem to feel the need to explain what motivates Leto to do what he has done, and why I should care about it. These are basic elements of the plot of this book and the previous one that are COMPLETELY LEFT TO THE READER'S IMAGINATION. IF you want me to care about your character and the story revolving around him, you have to tell me WHAT he is doing, WHY it is important, and most importantly, WHY I SHOULD CARE!!! These are basic storytelling elements that Herbert completely FAILED to employ.\n\nIn conclusion, this book is awful. It's a special kind of awful, the sort of which you will rarely find in fiction. It's basically a thinly disguised excuse for Herbert to give his own philosophies on life. If you want to write a book of philosophy, by all means, go ahead and do so. But don't try to tell me it's the next installment of your epic science fiction series. This book gets ZERO stars, but since the rating does not show up here on Goodreads with zero, I threw one up there. It feels FAR longer than it actually is. It centers around a character that is completely and utterly loathesome, without a SINGLE redeeming characteristic, and I'm supposed to feel for this character? Yeah, sorry Herbert, but no. I don't. I really, REALLY don't. This book is terrible in a way that few books are. And worst of all, it's boring. I can forgive bad writing. I can forgive a bad story. I can forgive wooden characters. It is my opinion that one of the truly unforgivable things that a storyteller can do, is to tell a boring story. Only the most hardcore fans of the Dune series will likely be able to find any enjoyment here, to any casual readers I typicaly recomend that this book be skipped over, because it really is THAT bad."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "[SPOILER ALERT: if you never read Children of Dune STOP NOW!]\nLeto II is now the God Emperor after merging with the sandtrout and becoming a monstrous worm-man powered by melange. He rules the known universe with an iron fist - not unlike his Aunt Alya did actually - but this is of course because he is SAVING the human race from itself. He has an army of woman, the Fish Speakers, that carry out his bidding spreading terror and, still, peace across his vast domain. He has reigned for 3000+ years and sees the end nearing.\n\nThere is a lot of philosophy here and it is interesting. perhaps it gets a little slow. I know several people that get fed up with the Tleilaxu ghola of Duncan Idaho's appearance (and, yes, he is back in Heretics of Dune as well). But overall, it was a good read.\n\nOne thing I still don't understand - and perhaps someone more versant in the Dune universe will enlighten me - is what was the threat to humanity that the Golden Path was initiated to alleviate? Was it just infighting that he thought would exterminate the human race? If so, just enforcing a brutal 3500 year peace was just postponing the inevitable? Perhaps this will be revealed in Heretics or Chapterhouse.\n\nAnother puzzling thing was the tolerance of Ix. Apparently, in the distant past before Dune, the Butlerian Jihad was raged against \"thinking\" machines which resulted in a world with human computers (Mentats and Guild Navigators) and a formal universal proscription of computers. However, Leto II apparently allows Ix to wind up production again as he purchases machines for transcribing his thoughts among other things. I found it a bit frustrating not to understand more how the Ixians themselves.\n\nI really love this series although I probably will not read the apocryphal 7 and 8 written after Frank died.\n\n[UPDATE] I am looking forward to Denis Villeneuve's Dune in October 2021. The previews I have seen so far seem to be quite coherent with respect to the book. I was a fan of Lynch's Dune and am curious to see what Villeneuve does with this one.

And the only one to understand this is Leto II, God Emperor of the Known Universe.

Fucking BRILLIANT stuff here, even if it's not fully borne out until the next novel. But wow. They don't make 'em like they used to."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "Okay, this was my second read of God Emperor of Dune. Honestly, it was quite an useful read because now I understand more precisely what was Leto's goal and the exact purpose of his Golden Path. To make a long story short the Golden Path is nothing more than the survival of the human race. At the end of the old empire (period described in the previous books) the human race has become doomed beyond hope with a corrupt and decadent feudal ruling system, stagnant and with an major addiction to substance ( the spice) that influenced almost all aspects of life (transportation, science, technological advancement, religion, food, etc) across the universe. The Bene Gesserit has foreseen humanity's disaster and they hoped to avoid it with the Kwisatz Haderach, the prescient messiah who will save us all. As we know, they lost control of it and Paul Muad'dib became Emperor on his own. Paul with his ability to see the future also saw the end of humanity and acted on it and he tried to save it with his Jihad. But wiping all resistance to his rule was not enough and something more drastic was needed. Because of Paul's love for his wife and because he still had his thirst for his humanity Paul couldn't make the ultimate sacrifice. Instead his son, Leto did it. Leto transformed himself in to a half man-half sandworm creature that permitted him to guide humanity on the Golden Path journey. The Golden Path acted on several different aspects. First, he needed to free the humanity from the spice addiction, thus during a long period of time he wiped out the sandworms, which wore the only source of spice and could live only in one place: Dune. Upon his foreseen death, Leto would breed a new kind of sandworms, with conscience and more intelligent and also with the ability to live on other planets besides Dune. Second, Leto also begun oppressing humanity like no ruler, (thos the Tyrant nickname) before him. This had also several reasons behind it: he slowly started reducing the spice addiction of humanity, by the end Leto's rule people wore almost free of it and the spice influenced only a few essential aspects of life (ex: space travel) . Also oppressing the people for long enough, he created a longing to be free of him, a desire for freedom (which is basically, the Scattering, in the following books). In particular, by oppressing the ixians and tleilaxu and not destroying them entirely, forced these two factions to be more inventive, creative and eventually it will lead them to discover space travel without the need of spice and the invention of artificial spice. Third, Leto had to be sure that in the future no other will ever posses the power he had possessed and that no person, no matter how prescient, would ever be able to track down all humanity and control like he did. So, he took from the Bene Gesserit their prized breeding plan and with Siona he managed to make a new kind of Atreides, free of the prescience vision. Fourth, with his all-female army, the Fish Speakers, Leto ensured that after he was gone, these women (with their training, discipline and life philosophy) will guaranty humanity's survival and guide them along the right path.\nGod Emperor of Dune might not by so actioned packed like the previous or the following books in the Dune Saga but it is most certainly the center one and the most important one of all."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "God Emperor of Dune (Dune #4), Frank Herbert\n\nGod Emperor of Dune is a science fiction novel by Frank Herbert published in 1981, the fourth in his Dune series of six novels.\n\nLeto II Atreides, the God Emperor, has ruled the universe as a tyrant for 3,500 years after becoming a hybrid of human and giant sandworm in Children of Dune.\n\nThe death of all other sand-worms, and his control of the remaining supply of the all-important drug melange, has allowed him to keep civilization under his complete command.\n\nLeto has been physically transformed into a worm, retaining only his human face and arms, and though he is now seemingly immortal and invulnerable to harm, he is prone to instinct-driven bouts of violence when provoked to anger.\n\nAs a result, his rule is one of religious awe and despotic fear.

I can't decide"}, {"label": "negative", "text": "Please, make it stop."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "It always astonished him how a desert provoked thoughts of religion.\n\nFrank Herbert gives the impression of being an iconoclastic, if somewhat dour, thinker and general navel-gazer. But there is a mischievous side to his intellect as well, as evinced by the running joke in \u2018God Emperor of Dune\u2019 about Leto II\u2019s scandalous sexual proclivities, a rumour spread by the dastardly Tleilaxu. Does the man-worm have any form of genitalia? At one point, Leto II wonders if he should sport a strap-on just to shock (let alone titillate) his court. However, he decides against it for decorum\u2019s sake.\n\nThus continues my first reread of the entire \u2018Dune\u2019 sequence since my teens, inspired by Denis Villeneuve\u2019s recent \u2018Part I\u2019 interpretation of half of the original book. Indeed, one wonders what Villeneuve would make of Leto II, especially given that his interpretation of Baron Harkonnen is probably the weakest element of a generally faithful (if overly reverential) movie adaptation. The reference to the Baron is apt, as there are several comparisons between the two monsters in \u2018God Emperor\u2019, and musings as to who has the grossest form. Leto II probably wins this contest hands down (actually, it is flippers.)\n\n\u2018Children of Dune\u2019 was a hot mess, with way too much expository mumbo-jumbo and clumsy writing that saw pivotal scenes like the sandtrout attaching to Leto\u2019s body failing to make any impact. It is ironic that \u2018God Emperor\u2019 starts as \u2018Children\u2019 does, with desperately fleeing people hunted by modified wolves \u2013 in this instance, it is Siona and her rebel friends who have made off with the man-worm\u2019s journals. (These so-called \u2018Stolen Journals\u2019 are the source of all the chapter epigraphs, adding a level of first-person commentary to the narrative rather than being completely extraneous to it.)\n\nSiona lives to fight another day. She features in one of the most magnificent setpieces in the book, when Leto II decides to \u2018test\u2019 her by taking her out into the Sareer, the last vestige of the great desert that once covered Arrakis. Herbert\u2019s nature writing, and in particular his passion for the ecology of Dune, shines through again in \u2018God Emperor\u2019 in this extended sequence, where you can almost taste the sand and feel its heat. Much of the planet has changed as well, including ironies such as the Idaho River and the Museum Fremen.\n\nDespite its length, \u2018God Emperor\u2019 curiously feels tighter than \u2018Children\u2019. This seems counterintuitive, especially as it is largely focused on the single character of Leto II. But the writing is certainly more cohesive. And the plot is tightly wound around three key action scenes, the last of which concludes Book #4 in a genuinely nailbiting fashion.\n\nWhat struck me rereading this is how much of a love story it is, interwoven with a lover\u2019s triangle. The tragic aspect comes from the repeated failing of the Duncan gholas, with the latest iteration falling head over heels for Hwi Noree, Leto II\u2019s own intended bride. Yup, it is Beauty and the Beast on Arrakis. With penis jokes.\n\nHwi is also the Ixian ambassador. She has been especially bred by those meddlesome tinkerers to be most emblematic of Leto II\u2019s greatest loss: his humanity. The man-worm generally cocks a snook at the proscriptions of the Butlerian Jihad, with everything from the royal suspensor cart to the royal elevators being dependent on Ixian technology.\n\nYou just know that this is likely to bite him in the ass, or whatever his equivalent of an ass is, when it is revealed that the Ixians are plotting a widget to replace a Guild Navigator and simultaneously nullify the spice. Which in this book is bright blue, as opposed to the traditional orange and familiar cinnamon smell attributed to it previously. I suppose it kind of makes sense in that melange-heads have blue-in-blue eyes. But I genuinely got the feeling here that Herbert thought: Fuck it, it is my sandbox. I will make the spice blue if I want to.\n\nThere is a lot of pontificating in \u2018God Emperor\u2019 about social engineering, such as the failed breeding experiments of the Bene Gesserit. Exactly why Siona is invisible to Leto\u2019s godlike prescience, and how this is linked to her\nis never spelt out. Surprisingly, the Golden Path itself barely gets a couple of mentions.\n\nProbably the most controversial aspect of \u2018God Emperor\u2019, apart from Leto II\u2019s priapic powers, of course, are the weirdly lesbian-cum-Amazonian Fish Speakers. The man-worm gives a half-assed explanation as to how a female army is more fanatical as it gets rid of homosexuality in its ranks, which drains men\u2019s energy and dilutes their focus on the job at hand of rape and pillage. And if you are thinking what is to stop the Fish Speakers indulging in same-sex proclivities themselves, Herbert has all perversions covered: The latest Duncan is much offended when he stumbles across a pair wrapped up in a passionate kiss. Tsk.\n\nThere is a truly bizarre scene towards the end where, watching the latest Duncan free-climb a nearly 1 km high bridge rampart, results in Nayla spontaneously orgasming just as he reaches the top. Go figure. However, I hasten to add that not nearly enough attention has been paid to Herbert\u2019s critique of gender and power relations in the \u2018Dune\u2019 sequence, and specifically in \u2018God Emperor\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to make a character as bizarre as Leto II appear both human and alien. The fact that Herbert makes the reader empathise with the man-worm\u2019s fate as his transformation into Shai-Hulud continues apace is testament to the peculiar magnetism of this strange book, probably one of the strangest in the entire Dune sequence, and certainly one of the most baroque SF novels ever written."}, {"label": "negative", "text": "Useful background book to read if you've ever thought you might like to rule the Universe.

Few books have mastered this combination of deep material with a hurtling plot, and this is one of them.\n\nOf the Dune Chronicles so far (this is book 4), God Emperor of Dune is my clear favorite. This profoundly philosophical installment in \"the bestselling sci-fi series of all time\" explores the now-verdant world of Arrakis thirty-five hundred years after the events in Children of Dune.\n\nLeto, the nine-year old son of Paul \"Muad'Dib\" Atreides, has assumed control of the galaxy-spanning empire described in the first three books, and has transformed himself into a grotesque synthesis of worm and human in an effort to avert a terrible catastrophe which would render all of humanity extinct. To be sure, Leto's transformation is both disturbing and uncomfortable (and yes, the full physical ramifications of this transformation are explored thoroughly), yet it feels quite naturally based in the mythology that Frank Herbert has laid out thus far in the series. It is the logical conclusion of a mythology steeped in the surreal and otherworldly.\n\nGod Emperor of Dune explores nature of despotism, the conditions under which it's called for, and the attendant concerns that such a dictator would have (amongst them the nature of religion, government, trade, rebellions, mythology, armies, sexuality, war, family, duty, and sacrifice) and depicts Leto's difficult - near impossible - choices and the poignant destiny which results from them.\n\nThe portrait of Leto - God, Emperor, saint, tyrant, martyr, human, sandworm - is a portrait of one of the most complex, sympathetic, and lonely characters I have ever encountered.

I am the waylaid pieces of history which sank out of sight in all of our pasts. Such an accumulation of riffraff has never before been imagined.\u201d\n\nMore than three thousand years have passed since the events described in the Great Dune Trilogy, and everything has changed. Arrakis is now a planet of running water and green growth, and the days of stillsuits and crysknives are gone. The Sandworms and the Fremen remain only as legends from the Ancient Days of Dune. Only one part remains from the old days: Leto II, the God Emperor.\n\nis, logically, a book centred around Leto. However, that is precisely its greatest problem. The so-called God Emperor who so valiantly sacrificed his human existence for that of an emperor doomed to serve his people by living through the ages and preserving the universe, has turned into a tyrant. And everyone sees him as such, except for himself and his fanatically loyal Fish Speaker cult. It seems as if though the book is an attempt to justify the government of Leto, and that is a task in which it fails miserably.\n\nBecause of that, one should think that there would be other people to sympathise with. People living under the oppression of Leto\u2019s rule joining together in rebellion against the monstrous tyrant. Well\u2026 there really aren\u2019t any. The rebels on Arrakis are led by Siona, the last of the Atreides line descending from Ghanima, Leto\u2019s sister. But in reality, Leto is allowing the rebellion to happen while secretly grooming Siona to become another of his instruments. Siona knows this, and knows that the God Emperor doesn\u2019t want her dead. That, of course, makes one wonder what the point is about the whole thing.\n\nNext to Leto and Siona, the rest of the characters are few and uninteresting. There were a couple of them in particular that were a bit interesting in the beginning, but my interest in them quickly evaporated into thin air. And when you don\u2019t have characters that are fun to read about, the book gets terribly boring after a while.\n\nThis book is actually not as bad as it sounds. The story was intriguing at times (not often, mind you), the great writing of Frank Herbert is still present, and the fourth book is just as much of a lesson in power and politics as the first three books.

Of course, it should be noted that I could sit and read a Dune Encyclopaedia (is theior one?) from cover to cover and be very content. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!\n\n\n\nOne note: I have both read the prin version and listened to the unabridged audiobook of this novel (as I have for all of the first 4 Dune novels) and I highly recommeded the audiobook to everyone.

However, if you are invested in the Dune Universe and you have read the original Dune Trilogy (Dune / Dune Messiah / Children of Dune) this can be a very rewarding, albeit challenging, read.\n\nPresented as part future historical text, part memoir and part mythos, is somewhat unlike any of the Dune novels that came before. Taking place more than 3000 years after the events of , but still revolving around Leto II (yes, he is that old by now), this book continues the Dune / Herbert tradition of subverting events that came before. And then some.\n\nWhile some of what transpires here was hinted at in the previous novel, it is still a somewhat uneasy turn of events. The book doesn\u2019t make it entirely clear who you should be rooting for, either. It\u2019s all grey area, and it takes a long time for character motives to become clearer. Half the people in the story don\u2019t seem to know what the hell is going on either, which does make for a truly remarkable reading experience (intended or otherwise).\n\nThere are fewer characters this time round, with just about everything revolving around the God Emperor and his actions. The only additional characters are the (befuddled) few with whom the emperor has surrounded himself.\n\nThe narrative is interspersed with quotes from the history of the Dune universe, as well as diary entries, notably those of the God Emperor himself. As such, the flow of the novel takes some getting used to. It is heavy on philosophical meandering and, to a lesser extent, political maneuvering. The story takes the view, and concerns itself with the future of the human race on an as dictated by the \u201cGolden Path\u201d that Leto is following via his (by now very formidable) prescience. As such, there is very little in the sense of immediate gratification. In fact, compared to this, the original is a pretty straightforward adventure yarn. This, by the way, is not a criticism; I love the original .\n\nI suppose it would be easy to dislike this book, based on how strange it truly is. And you wouldn\u2019t know how strange unless you read it. It is perhaps worth noting that Herbert had some aid in the form of magic mushrooms when writing some of his Dune stories (by his own admission). Perhaps is case in point. All in all, a mind-bending affair.\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, though, it is telling that I wasn\u2019t indifferent to the fates of the main character(s). There are some memorable scenes (and one fairly moving one) toward the close of the novel that puts everything in perspective. The story had, after all, managed to get under my skin, and in the end, everything makes a tragic sort of sense.

He had said all he wished to say about Paul Atreides and his legacy, and about the spice, and sandworms, and the Bene Gesserit, and the like. He would move on to other matters.\n\nAnd so he did. The Dosadi Experiment followed hard on the heels of Children of Dune, first published in the summer of 1977. This was succeeded by a screenplay for a movie in 1978, and complicated legal wrangling involving the writing and rewriting of , which was published in 1979. Competing negotiations for a film version of preoccupied Herbert during the summer of 1980. During this period he also coauthored a now almost unreadable book about new technology just beginning to arrive on the scene, 1980's .\n\nAs early as 1977, however, Herbert had admitted that he felt pressure to continue the series, although he was uncommitted to doing so. He said then: \"The thing that attracts me is, say, coming back to the character of Leto 3,400 years later . . .\"\n\nWhen Herbert did decide to return to the Duniverse, he felt free of any constraints so far as the plot was concerned. So long as he remained within the general boundaries established in the original trilogy, he was free to write about absolutely anything he desired. He must have felt very liberated, knowing he had a guaranteed audience and to be able to start fresh. He wrote the fourth book in the series between March 1979 and July 1980. Published in May 1981, is Frank Herbert's magnum opus.\n\nreads like a convoluted Shakespearian tragedy, but bumps it up a couple orders of magnitude: here we find not excessively Byzantine plot convolutions, but rather a graceful and elegant prose found nowhere else in Herbert's writing. Herbert had begun to consciously try to meld literary and science fiction in , and that experimentation reaches its apex in this novel. is the most literary science fiction novel I've ever read. This is precisely the kind of writing that I wish all science fiction authors would try to meet or exceed.\n\nIn the character Leto II had unambiguously declared that the choice for humanity was one of extinction or his Golden Path: some dangerous was embedded in the human psyche that needed to be corrected. In writing this novel, Herbert asked himself one question: fix\n\nWithin that question lies the character of Leto II, and the character of Leto II provokes all of the action of the story.\n\nI'll give away none of the plot here, but in order to appreciate the tragedy that is it's important to consider the quality of the main character, Leto II.\n\nIn the earlier books, the primary superheroic gift of Paul Atreides was an ability to foresee many different possible futures. The ability of Alia, and of the Bene Gesserit, was to assimilate the life-experiences of their past ancestors. In Leto II Herbert has merged these gifts. The God Emperor has extraordinary access to all spacetime, past and future: he is the real Kwisatz Haderach. Furthermore, enveloped as he is in a skin that is not his own, he has become virtually indestructible and immortal. He may not have the power of physical creation at his fingertips, but for all practical purposes Herbert has created in Leto II what may be at once the strangest and the most believable god-figure in literature.\n\nLeto II contains and can access the full-life experiences of all his ancestors, back to the dawn of human consciousness. So how many personages are rattling around within the psyche of the God Emperor? Counting generations backwards in time, each of us has 2*2^ ancestors, which means after only = 19 (, 19 generations back), we each have more than a million ancestors. As Herbert elsewhere (, in ) posits human consciousness originated 16,000 years ago, a bit of math suggests that Leto II has direct access to approximately 3.0 x 10^371 fully integrated ancestral lifetime memory-records! Add to that his prescient abilities, and this character is suddenly discovered to be the Alexandrian library incarnate multiplied to an unprecedented degree. His experience of humanity is legion. Nowhere else in fiction, to my knowledge, has the portrayal of a character even remotely like this one been attempted. Given this understanding, Leto's unique perspective on the human condition becomes a bit more comprehensible. 3,500 years to such a creature can seem little more than the blink of an eye. He can scarcely be concerned with the individual: it is only survival of the species that matters to him. This makes him the ultimate alien, the enigmatic sphinx whose utterances may be heard and recorded but must be interpreted within the context of millennia.\n\npresents us with Herbert's most careful, most thoughtful, most philosophical, most profound writing of his life, and the prose of its telling is exquisite. Every page is alive and electric, jolting with new insights. To have made the prolonged journey with Herbert over the long years and to arrive at this point with him is a kind of privilege. For more than any other character he created, Leto II is inseparable from Frank Herbert.

While Children of Dune is quite underrated in my opinion, I believe that it is the spice that is harvested for God Emperor to truly have visions. (And I'm not even done here)"}, {"label": "positive", "text": "4,5/5"}, {"label": "neutral", "text": "I keep going back and forth on this rating. Reading this series has been a truly weird experience. The first book is a straight up classic that I enjoy reading, despite some issues with it being dated and gross in places. I will read it again! I will see the movie. The second two books I appreciated on an intellectual level but they did not engage me emotionally at all. I was very much dreading the rest of the series after reading those books. And then . . . this book. I don't even really know what to say about it? In general, my reaction is just sort of . . . what the fuck? But not in a bad way, mostly?\n\nSo, the title of this review may have given it away, but our main character is Leto Atreides II, the son of Paul and Chani, and he's 3,500 years old at this point, and is basically God Emperor of the universe. He's also transformed physically, and is still transforming, into a sandworm of Dune, though he still retains a human face and arms (his feet are vestigial \"flippers\" . . . gag). (I'm still not clear on why this is happening, or even why he chose to merge with the whatever they're called at the end of the last book, but whatever, I'm going with it.) He is full on a tyrant. Like, he acknowledges this to everyone, out loud. He is all-knowing, and prophetic, and he has the entirety of human history in his mind. And he has some overarching bullshit plan that he likes to vaguely hint at while proselytizing to anyone who will listen.\n\nSo the thing about this book is that I kind of hated the storyline, and the main character was incredibly unlikable and almost totally unrelatable, but! It did engage me emotionally. I read it pretty fast, all things considered, when I crawled through the previous two. I'm not sure if it was the WTF factor, or the fact that Leto kept making me angry, or that the things that were happening were escalations of fuckery, or all three. There's also the fact that 3,500 years have passed since we last visited Arrakis so we get to go through the process of discovery again, sort of. It's still the same basic universe and planet, but things have changed, and it was interesting to see how, and speculate as to why. I also did like several of the secondary characters (although, some of them verge on sharing protagonist credit with Leto).\n\n\nThis is our guy!\n\nOne of those characters is a clone of Duncan Idaho. I keep thinking we've seen the last of this character (I thought he was full on dunzo halfway through book one, and I was so sad, because Jason Momoa is playing him, but don't worry, Jason, your paychecks are secure forever as long as the movies are a hit). But I think that Herbert was in love with him (despite his very obvious homophobia) and kept bringing him back. Just like Leto does in this book, and in the 3,500 years leading up to it. There have been a succession of Duncan Idaho clones, or gholas as they're called in this universe. Leto goes through a lot of them, either losing them to old age, or more likely, to betrayal or \"treason\" as the Duncans grow bitter about their master and turn on him. Basically, Leto has been tormenting Duncan Idaho for thousands of years.\n\nThere's a lot of politicking with the Bene Gesserit and the dirty Tleixaxu, as per usual, but also introduced here is a rebellion led by Leto's sister Ghanima's descendant, Siona. Cool thing to know about Siona: She's the result of Leto's \"breeding program.\" Breeding for what, who knows! Oh, and did I say cool? What I meant is fuck you, Leto. Apparently one of Leto's favorite things to do in order to control a population (aside from making them all complacent with peace and feudal level technology) is to foster rebellion and then disarm it by bringing the leaders to his side. He did this with Siona's father, Moneo, who is also a POV character.\n\nI almost two starred this because Leto will not shut up, and half of what he says is worth thinking about and he had some points, but then the other half is absolute nonsense. Like his gender essentialist thoughts about why it's the best to have an all female army, and his homophobic thoughts about how armies make you gay if you're a dude, and homosexuals are bad! There were strong hints of Herbert's homophobia in book one, what with making the main villain being a gay pedophile, but here it's all out in the open. Leto spouts all his theories with a surety that is aggravating. The problem here is that if this type of character did exist in real life (one who could see all of history and desires to shepherd humanity away from destruction), he would not hold a lot of these opinions. A lot of the opinions don't even make sense! Literally, did not know what he was saying. Herbert was not the best at making his meaning clear, so the result is garbled. And yet, I did not stop reading. It grabbed me.\n\nThe thing is, I see what Herbert was going for (after having read the Dune wiki to make sure), and I admit some of the themes he was working with here are interesting. Leto gives up his humanity because he wants to make it so that no single threat can every destroy the entirety of humanity, and this is the only way that his prescience tells him he can do that. Also, there's a lot of stuff in here about the conflicting desires and needs of humans. We want peace, but we flourish under adversity. This is partly how Leto has been Emperor for so long, because he understands this. The story he used to convey this was such weird nonsense, though. I can't emphasize that enough. Leto sucks.\n\nLast thoughts. Only Frank Herbert could have turned this:\n\n\n\n\n\nInto this:\n\n\n\n[2.5 stars, rounded up because what even??]"}, {"label": "positive", "text":

interpretation of Dune that will be shown in theaters this year so I decided to not only read the original book but also the rest of the series.\n\nThis books shows Leto II having become a God Emperor to the known universe. Leto still has a human face but the rest of the body is covered in sand trouts. He\u2019s 7m long, 2m wide, the legs have developed back into some form of fin, his arms are still recognizably human though. He knows he\u2019ll turn into a full worm soon.\nWe also re-encounter Duncan Idaho. Yep, Leto keeps awakening gholas of the original Atreidis bodyguard and uses them for different roles.\nLeto and Duncan are the only familiar characters we meet in this volume. Because we start this 4th book off about 3500 years in the future from the previous three books!\n\nLeto II has carefully enforced the Golden Path, the great plan to ensure the survival of the human race, all this time. In order to create peace and ensure the survival of us all, he has ruled with an iron fist, holding back most spice, prohibiting mental training and making other \"questionable\" choices.\nSpice is rare (not least because almost all sandworms are gone), Arrakis is a forest planet complete with wolves patrolling a citadel and inhabitants that don\u2019t even all believe the stories of the planet once having been a desert.\nAt the beginning of the tale, a few youths break into Leto\u2019s \"tomb\" on Arrakis, dreaming of glory like the mythological Fremen (yep, there are no actual Fremen anymore either), cursing Leto and being determined to destroy him so as to end his rule! Instead, what they end up doing is stealing personal journals.\n\n\nThe one opposing Leto the most is Siona, a descendent of Ghanima and Farad\u2019n (\n).\nOne must understand that despite people living longer than 100 years thanks to Melange/Spice, I doubt that the people living in any given moment could truly comprehend the full plan. The interesting part was that when Siona, for example, saw the Golden Path during her spice-induced trance, she still didn\u2019t agree.\nHowever, peace comes at a price and Leto has learned to make the hard choices (\n). And that is what has earned him more and more enemies (from within the Empire and outside, because they all want more power for themselves). So yes, several factions are planning the God Emperor\u2019s death.\n\nThere is so much more to look at, so much more getting explored all the while we\u2019re following Leto, Siona, Duncan and a few others \u2026 but I can\u2019t spoiler too much. Let\u2019s just say that, as usual, there are plans within plans, and god-like powers do not mean there is no risk to Leto. But maybe that\u2019s the whole point?\n(\n)\n\nIn my opinion, this 4th book was the weirdest, most alien, and \"worst\" so far. I don\u2019t know if it is due to there being hardly any people I knew and couldn\u2019t connect with Siona very much, or if it was for some other reason.\nSimultaneously, though, it was truly awesome! Not just the typical writing style (which, yes, I love) or the fact that it felt like a story about Ancient Egypt (despite Arrakis no longer being a desert) but also where the author is taking this series, what has happened in this book alone, also what has happened between books 3 and 4, and what might still happen until the end of the series - the scope is actually blowing my mind! I loved how every step served a purpose, how the author never took the easy way out and made us embark on a journey full of twists and turns that has such an intelligent plot, I can only marvel at his creation.\n\nSo yeah, I\u2019m quite confused now. *lol* Mind you, \"worst\" book still puts this firmly ahead of most others I\u2019ve read. I\u2019m simply comparing it with the others of this series that I\u2019ve read so far.\nNot to mention that the books make you think a lot about our reality. The danger of religion or - in this volume, specifically - about the theory regarding stagnation being the death of any species (and what that means for us right now) to name but two examples (I agree with the author regarding both). Considering when the books were written, how the author concealed his theories (had to), \u2026 it is irrefutable proof of his intelligence.\n\nI can't wait to continue."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "I've decided that one can't really unpack everything in these books in a single reading. As before, there is a lot of philosophy of mind, society, science, and religion integrated throughout.

About everything.\n\nCompared to the previous three books, Dune, Dune Messiah, and Children of Dune, this one is the most opaque, and while I enjoyed it, it was not my favourite of the four I have read so far. That said, it should be kept in mind that Herbert's grand story and his incredibly literate writing still make for an amazing book. continues to reflect the ambitiousness present in the previous books in the series.\n\nI continue to enjoy the audio versions of these books.

I do like the trial Siona went through with Leto, but I don't feel like I know much about how Siona became who she is now.\n\nThe topics of immorality, tyranny and religion are brought up repeatedly throughout the story, I can imagine not everyone is gonna love these, I also have mixed feelings about these fictional tyrants (e.g. Leto II, the Lord Ruler from the Mistborn series) who have a\n, you know.

It had long sections that was a bit boring but important for future story lines. I was intrigued by the clones of Duncan and the long life and changes of Leto. It was sad at the end."}, {"label": "negative", "text": "Okay, so I adore the Dune series and have done ever since I read Dune for the first time as a teenager, which is why I was so disappointed by how bad this book is. This book is reeeeally bad. At first I thought bad in a fun, wacky sci-fi sort of way, but then it became both boring AND incredibly offensive, and by about 70% I was just powering through, hoping to get to the end so I could be done with it.\n\nThe book is ostensibly about Leto's attempt to carry out the \"golden path\" he foresaw at the end of Children of Dune, a sacrifice which turns him into a giant gross infertile sandworm, and which is important in order to prevent a vaguely alluded to disaster to humanity. (Why was the reveal of the actual potential disaster so low key??? Surely it should be a big deal, as both the reason for Leto's super boring peace empire, and the proof of his own humanity??)\n\nHowever, there really isn't much plot at all, just the worst kind of pseudo-philosophical pontificating which Herbert confined to a chapter or two in his earlier books. Dune is a novel absolutely bursting with ideas, but none of the ideas in God Emperor of Dune really come together to say anything meaningful, even though it explores a lot of the same themes as the earlier books in the series. Like, reading Dune I thought that Herbert had a really interesting perspective on organized religion and its purpose in society, but reading this book it just seemed like he had a weirdly sexist fixation with female priestesses. This intellectual laziness is compounded by the supposedly incomprehensibly massive intellectual capabilities of the main character who has like a thousand geniuses living in his head, and this makes it impossible to believe in the central conceit of the book, which amounts to a fatal flaw for a sci-fi novel.\n\nAs far as I can tell, what the book is ACTUALLY about is Frank Herbert's prejudice and anxieties about sexuality and gender, which he projects onto the characters in really uncomfortable and awkward ways. Maybe I am wrong about this but I DO NOT KNOW HOW ELSE TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK.\n\nIt's important to note that Leto is sexually repulsive and has no loins, because this is hammered home to us repeatedly in this book. So, Leto UNCOMFORTABLY PHALLIC Atreides II married his twin sister one time ages ago, and had many unconsummated brides, and shares a love of the soul with his test-tube fiance, and although he can produce no real sperm he carries the metaphorical sperm of the future in his body which he plans to release as tiny pearls of his consciousness during his transformation when he goes Full Sandworm.\n\nDuncan Idaho is super handsome and every single woman of Leto's oversexualised priestess army wants to have his babies, but Leto tells him that his sperm is intended for Siona, which stresses Duncan out because he is not just a stud and wants to be valued for more than just HIS loins. Duncan is alarmed by Leto's bizarre, inaccurate and deeply offensive theory that being in the army makes you sadistic and gay (this is why Leto needs an army of sexually adventurous women who focus all their adoration on him, obvs), because one time Idaho experimented with another guy in his youth. I can't tell if it makes it better or worse for me that Duncan's over the top homophobia comes from a place of repressing his own gay experiences. Everything is so clumsy and heavy-handed. I just can't tell!!\n\nMy overriding impression of the book is that it's Weird About Sex, but not in a fun or interesting way, rather in a wearyingly, forcedly, desperately heterosexual way. In the epilogue which tells us about Duncan and Siona's future legacy the people from the future exclaim loudly that they had a lot of sons, because don't you dare forget that the most important thing about these two slightly more interesting than the rest characters is that they ended up PRODUCING MANY MALE HEIRS as a good arranged breeding pair should do!!!! I thought the Bene Gesserit breeding program was another interestingly alien aspect of the world Herbert created but it turns out the concept isn't alien to the author at all; I think actually he just thinks that good relationships are about people breeding according to some appointed scheme. Reading this book is like an open window being slammed shut on your fingers.\n\nSome other things happen in this book: some people rebel pointlessly, some others scheme fruitlessly and at one point a woman orgasms spontaneously from watching Duncan Idaho climb up a wall. Let's just not talk about it.\n\nTo give God Emperor of Dune credit where it is due, I laughed quite a lot when I wasn't cringing in horror, and I was very engaged throughout, mostly because I was composing furious rants about Leto Atreides in my head. (Remember how great Leto I was?? And Paul and Chani's tragically dead first baby, also called Leto? It is an OUTRAGE that this deeply inadequate later Leto became the main Leto of the series.) So I nearly gave this book two stars but I didn't because I feel that it's important to recognise how bad it is. As a novel, as a piece of literature, it's awful."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "A deep and unflattering meditation on the human condition and whether near absolute tyranny can free mankind from certain of these trappings, Frank Herbert's God Emperor of Dune is my favourite novel of what is a monumental series and one of the greatest in all of science fiction.\nThis review offers an excellent and concise summary of what the book does for the story.\n\nBe warned however that this novel doesn't offer a smooth silk thread of a plot where characters are affixed colourful and appreciable beads sliding along through well-paced curves and loops to a conclusion. The structure is unorthodox and consists mainly and most significantly of digressions from the eponymous God Emperor, Leto II, whose sacrifice in order to set humanity on the Golden Path his father deferred, has physically and mentally alienated him from it. In something of a reversal of the fate Frazer gives for the , the God Emperor suppresses and goads the various factions of his new empire to force the end he desires in order to jolt civilisation out of stagnation.\nbriefly notes how this is a glimpse of 'alien motives' \u00e0 la Lovecraft, which is a very astute observation. At times Leto thinks of the Golden Path as a necessity for humankind's survival quite independently from the transient viewpoint of his human subjects, almost as an intellectual problem. Rarely do we find gods written about intimately in literature. The pitfalls are obvious. This is why all the facets and complexity Herbert bestows on his eponymous character here such a feat- unparalleled in my view.\n\nNumerous, often coy insights into the past that leads to doom if not for his Golden Path are ruminated upon by Leto alongside ambiguities which must be addressed at this late stage in his plans before his own necessary demise. To appreciate these requires a broad view of the complex social dynamics in Herbert's universe and an almost cynical openness to how a technologically advanced species might adapt economically, culturally and politically to the long reign of such a threat as the God Emperor. That Herbert was able to distill such far-reaching machinations and give voice to them through Leto instead of letting the narrative unravel more disconnectedly (but perhaps as effectively) as in Stapledon's and Asimov's work is a feat of daring which still strains credulity as I look back on this work.\n\nIt isn't that the other characters are particularly flawed compared to the other novels, but their shortcomings and struggles of limited scope, given our view through Leto's eyes, appear to condemn the whole of humanity, past and present, which has accepted, but moreover was found desperately needing Leto's direction."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "The pattern of monarchies and similar systems has a message of value for all political forms. My memories assure me that governments of any kind could profit from this message. Governments can be useful to the governed only so long as inherent tendencies toward tyranny are restrained. Monarchies have some good features beyond their star qualities. They can reduce the size and parasitic nature of the management bureaucracy. They can make speedy decisions when necessary. They fit an ancient human demand for parental (tribal/feudal) hierarchy where every person knows his place. It is valuable to know your place, even if that place is temporary. It is galling to be held in place against your will. This is why I teach about tyranny in the best possible way\u2014by example.

He saw this as the only way to preserve the Golden Path. Clever stuff."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "I absolutely love this book. God Emperor of Dune is different from others novels in the series, and while I can understand why it might be off putting to some, for me this is the most beautiful and personal narrative in the whole series. I applaud Herbert for trying out something different and going for a book that was so heavily focused on an individual...and what an individual he is! A god who dislikes religion, because: \u201cReligious institutions perpetuate a mortal master-servant relationship,\u201d Leto said. \u201cThey create an arena which attracts prideful human power-seekers with all of their nearsighted prejudices!\u201d Leto II is one of my all time favourite characters!\n\nI read this book years ago, but so many thoughts from God Emperor of Dune are still with me. I can't tell you how many times my mind has remembered something Leto II has said. If you want to avoid spoilers, now is a good time to stop reading this review. It is impossible to say something coherent about it without referring to the third novel in the series, so if you haven't read that one, there might be spoilers for it here as well. This novel is fourth in Dune's series, and although it is in some ways different from others, I would still recommend you to read the others as well, because this book is best understood in the context of Dune universe. I suppose that in some ways God Emperor of Dune might be an interesting read on its own, especially since it is a more personal narrative, but as I said, it is best read as a part of a series.\n\nThis novel is set in a very different universe, one that is thousands of years away from where the third novel left off. Leto II has access to complete historical records, which allow him to study human evolution- an important theme for this book. At the start of this book, Leto II has ruled the known universe for 3, 5000 years, and the son is nothing like the father (even if he has ever been). Leto II has destroyed Paul's Fremen army and their identity, replacing it with his own Fish Eaters, an all female army. Many known powers from the old universe are either destroyed, suppressed or kept on a very tight leash in this world ruled by one power. That's not the only thing that makes God Emperor of Dune different from the books predating it- a large portion of books is written in the form of quotations, monologues and speeches of Leto II. Apparently, Herbert wrote the first draft of the novel as a first person narrative of Leto II. It definitely shows.\n\nI loved learning more about God Emperor of Dune as the novel progressed. At first I didn't know how to feel about him. I mean Leto II is a three thousand year old giant worm, a god of sorts, who also happens to be a ruthless and absolute dictator of the known world, a powerful tyrant who is - wait for it- actually saving the human race by suppressing and opposite them until they can't take it any longer and become ready to scatter into space, thus saving themselves from the threat of extinction. Alright, that was a long sentence. If Leto II wasn't written so brilliantly, this would have been a dull novel. Fortunately, the God Emperor is endlessly fascinating and touchingly human in his strangeness. Another odd but interesting detail was Leto II transformation. He is part animal, part human. As a human, he is more than any human has ever been (having lived for thousands of years as well as having access to full history of human race) but there is also an animal like characteristic to him. When Leto II gets angry, he kills. This kept me on edge as the novel progressed. It created a weird contrast between his highly intelligent and absolutely wild persona.\n\nLeto II take on politics is just as fascinating. Take what he says about conservatives and liberals:\n\nI can't forget this jewel of a thought either: \"\u201cRemember that there exists a certain malevolence about the formation of any social order. It is the struggle for existence by an artificial entity. Despotism and slavery hover at the edges. Many injuries occur and, thus, the need for laws. The law develops its own power structure, creating more wounds and new injustices. Such trauma can be healed by cooperation, not by confrontation. The summons to cooperate identifies the healer.\u201d\n\nWhat Leto II thinks of police and military is fascinating as well:\n\n\u201cPolice always observe that criminals prosper. It takes a pretty dull policeman to miss the fact that the position of authority is the most prosperous criminal position available.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnceasing warfare gives rise to its own social conditions which have been similar in all epochs. People enter a permanent state of alertness to ward off attacks. You see the absolute rule of the autocrat. All new things become dangerous frontier districts\u2014new planets, new economic areas to exploit, new ideas or new devices, visitors\u2014everything suspect. Feudalism takes firm hold, sometimes disguised as a politbureau or similar structure, but always present. Hereditary succession follows the lines of power. The blood of the powerful dominates.\u201d\n\nWhy did the Leto II had to create the golden path? Because he understood the need. The world he was supposed to rule was deeply unstable. His father Paul unleashed religious fantastic onto the world, the Bene Gessiret were growing increasingly powerful as were other fractions and power allegiances controlling the human race. Let us not forget that Dune society of old is basically a feudal system and as such bound to be unjust. There is so much sense in what God Emperor did- but does that justify him? Leto II is a tyrant but there is logic in his seeming madness. It was fantastic seeing the story unfold. There are a lot of moral dilemmas in this one, lot of things to wrap your head around.\n\nI'm not sure how I felt about Duncan ghola to be honest. I feel like there is more to Duncan that I was able to see. At times he seemed to be there only as recipient of Leto's messages, but at times Duncan seems like something more. I think I still need to figure him out, and the emperor's use of Duncan as well. Why is he so important to him? I mean besides the obvious reason revealed by the end of the book.\n\n\n\u201cDuncan, I am a teacher. Remember that. By repetition, I impress the lesson.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat lesson?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ultimately suicidal nature of military foolishness.\u201d"}, {"label": "negative", "text": "Buddy Read with Markus\n\nActual Rating: 2.5 stars\n\n\n\nI was born Leto Atreides II more than three thousand standard years ago, measuring from the moment when I cause these words to be printed.

Like, the universe opens its eye and watches you watching it. That kind of weird.\n\nOne weird thing about this book, aside from the title being the most metal thing on earth, is that it is essentially one long scene. Herbert finds ways to break it up, of course, but really, it's somehow 400 pages of all the characters saying, \"What's your deal, God Emperor of Dune?\" and then Leto II, the God Emperor Sandworm-Man, speaking in riddles that drive you crazy. This book literally doesn't explain anything until the last 4 pages, which really shouldn't work, 400 pages of questions and 4 pages of answers, and it doesn't work, I guess, not totally, except while you are reading it, during which time it totally does.\n\nHerbert uses this book, essentially, to discuss the nature of societal power structures, and what about them works and doesn't work, and why he believes this is so. And because Herbert's not actually a sociologist and Leto II is not actually a trustworthy or sympathetic character, the layers of interpretation you need to go through just to make sense of the book's ideas are hard to even pinpoint. Reading this book is like herding cats, if cats were made of light.\n\nis not only really fun to say, it is also a pretty cool book to read.

But with each sequel, it gets less interesting. They aren't so much about plot but world-building, with a new paradigm endlessly explained while little story progresses.\n\nIn this iteration, Leto the second has lived for thousands of years and is mutated into a worm by the spice or something.

The trilogy has a fantastic conclusion and the premise of this novel, depending on the person is a tough pill to swallow. Consider this novel more of an interesting introspect epilogue of that trilogy. Anyways this will contain MAJOR spoilers for Dune 1-3 as this novel is set 3500 years in the future. Now people who read the novel hope you like my review of this fantastic piece of literature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe themes I\u2019ve stated above is only becoming more explicit with God Emperor of Dune. His son Brian surprisingly says some insightful stuff in the introduction.\n\n\n\nLeto following with the Golden Path. In the process, stagnated Humankind for over millennia. This novel is difficult to keep spoiler-free because its existence is such an anomaly. However, I do my utmost best to talk about it.\nA noteworthy aspect of the introduction of this novel is that we are observing from numerous Historians perspective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt recontextualises the excerpts from Dune Trilogy (mainly this entry). So, all those excerpts we read from the trilogy and even for Book 4 be related to this time. The Historians is trying to uncover what truly happened over the millennia ago. Regarding the plot, I won\u2019t go into depth about what it is, because best to have no real understanding when approaching the sequel. The characters from the past are historical legends and have landmarks associated with them. Kynes Sea, the Idaho River, Cult of Alia and even The Keeper of Jessica\u2019s Light as a priestess. These are just natural occurrences in history, especially considering the actions they have conducted.\n\nQuite interesting are the people idolising a prior tyrant, sadly because of Baron during that time. But leaves you speculating maybe she was at peace but slowly became corrupted we are unsure which time period of Alia their idolising. It's an interesting note because the values of Alia changed drastically from book 2 to book 3, because of 9 years of slow corruption. Being ambiguous about the situation is great as it reflects real life. In various cults, you don\u2019t understand the values of their preaching \u2026 you just know the figure their preaching.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot just these but there are numerous times where their insightful philosophical debate, because of framing of the novel.

It is the same strengths. Though there is one aspect, I will talk about, regarding events occurring off-screen. Because of the framing of the novel, it containing off-screen activity makes perfect sense. It is not like Dune Messiah, where should have been shown not just off-screen. Observing events as, Historian of sorts so yeah, they will be gaps. That said for the few action sequences the novel contains their pretty much good. It caught me off guard, really didn\u2019t expect any whatsoever. That isn't to state they are plentiful but some action sequences throughout, which are well written.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndeniable to state Paul Atreides is Herbets best-written character. They a lot of humanity to Paul when observing his arc retrospectively that is profound and tragic. However, Leto has a lot of depth to him in this novel, compared to his last entry. In CoD, he was well-written enough but couldn\u2019t compare to the other cast ( Alia, Jess and Paul). But now it's a much further examination because Leto has become a tyrant. They are a human tragedy to his character. Imagine living past everyone that you cared for and abide by the Golden Path which according to him, is for Humanity survival. There are numerous ways to write this character poorly as it's tough to balance what to show and what not to show. Leto has enough personality to be engaging to read, but also distant, so it doesn\u2019t feel out of place. He has his Temper tantrums like his outbursts of jealously that come into the mix.\nHe is a beautifully written character who is the heart and soul of this novel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne character above has already been highlighted.

It's honestly one of the best novels I\u2019ve read not for everyone especially can be jarring for fans of the original Dune.

In this fourth entry of the Dune series, the law of diminishing returns is at work. I enjoyed the first three books to a point, but as I'm figuring out now, the more you get into the series the more necessary it becomes to read the next book in order to fully enjoy and understand the previous book---the exception might be the first book since it's pretty good on its own but it does end kind of suddenly.\n\nBut with each subsequent book the plot centers more and more around some never fully explained McGuffin that is talked around, mentioned obliquely, or couched in esoteric gobbledygook language that doesn't help in understanding anything. And always this unexplained thing is relatively simple to explain and is actually really important to the overall story... of the book. All is eventually kinda sorta revealed almost at the end of one book... but we don't see the effects of this revelation until the next book. Having the payoff to the book you're reading now happen in the book you haven't read yet... not so great.\n\nI don't like books that treat the reader as if they can't possibly understand anything and are heavy handed in explaining everything, but neither do I like stories, dialogue, or plot points that skip past being puzzling yet solvable directly into enigmatic and pretentious.\n\nI know this book was more philosophical and... meditative? than the others, but there was this constant bringing up of certain topics that elicited reactions in the characters that were totally lost on me because not even a hint of context is given. There are certain things we as a reader can't possibly know because this made up world hasn't been fully explained to us.\n\nBut over and over in this book there are allusions made that assume a certain level of in-world knowledge that just doesn't exist. This was okay in the first book since everything made sense after we spent time in the world (not to mention the glossary's help in defining a lot of words) but now, in this book, which takes place in what is essentially a vastly different world, the reader is left out in the cold.\n\nAlso, the plot is rather simple for the number of pages it covers but that's due to innumerable conversations that explain (or more likely obscure) the philosophy and politics of the world/universe. It's interesting (at times) but the characters (except maybe for Leto) are all cardboard cutouts for different points of view. They are challenged here and there, they struggle over their situations and choices, but it was all rather mechanical. I never really got to 'know' them. One example: two characters fall in love. Why do they fall in love? , that's why! It's an unbelievable and forced event, plot-dictated rather than 'realistic'.\n\nThis is how the book comes across to me:\n\n-The Ixians have sent you a fruit basket.\n-The Ixians are... clever, aren't they? (raises eyebrow)\n-You mean...? (shudder)\n-Yes! They have finally reached their utmost capabilities. has happened.\n-You don't mean they've...?\n-Yes.\n-They built...?\n-Yes.\n-And they also...?\n-Yes.\n-But I thought...?\n-No.\n-Have they also...?\n-Yes.\n-Shall I...?\n-Mmmmm...... not yet. Let's wait one minute and three seconds.\n-May I eat one of the fruits?\n-Do butterflies tap dance on a monkey's tricycle?\n-Huh?\n-ANSWER ME!\n-I I I---If it serves my Lord it will be tap danced.\n-Ah hah hah, you amuse me. Wandering in a desert is as rewarding as a desert wandering in you.\n-Yes my Lord.\n-YOU KNOW NOTHING OF DESERTS! YOU KNOW NOTHING OF FRUITS! I HAVE LIVED A THOUSAND LIVES IN A DESERT AND BEEN A MILLION EATERS OF FRUIT!\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI think maybe I need a break from the series.

That said I would have to agree that it has its issues: Herbert\u2019s penchant to tell instead of show (esp. through inner monologues, or in this case Leto worm-splaining his ways to others) is on display, but somehow I find that it works in the Dune books, perhaps partly because I find the content so intriguing, and partly because sometimes a writer can break the \u2018rules\u2019 when it serves the story overall.\n\nAnd yes, I agree that this is a weird book\u2026and they\u2019re only going to get weirder as the series progresses, but I think that\u2019s a feature, not a bug. My guess is that most readers coming off of the initial \u2018trilogy\u2019 with its close-up view of the initial seizing of power in the Imperium by the Atreides ultimately want more of the same. More Muad\u2019Dib, more rhythmless desert-walking, more blue-within-blue eyes, but Herbert wanted to move on\u2026and I applaud him for it. It likely goes without saying that the universe in which a cadre of drug-addled psychic witches with a secret breeding scheme for humanity that results in the untimely advent of the messianic Kwisatz Haderach who launches a galaxy-spanning jihad through the use of prescience can only go somewhere truly weird from where it began. The evolution of a worm-human hybrid that holds humanity\u2019s future in a steel grip for ends that only he came foresee seems like a great swerve to me. I\u2019ve said it before, and I\u2019ll say it again: Herbert was pretty brave in moving forward with his story of the Dune universe instead of simply cashing in and giving the public more of the same (oh, hi there Brian Herbert!) Like it or not, he went where the story took him even if it wasn\u2019t where all of his readers necessarily wanted him to go.\n\nAside from his ecological themes and concerns I think you could safely say that one of Herbert\u2019s main interests in the Dune series is the investigation of what it means to be human. From the first testing of Paul by the Reverend Mother Mohiam to something of a culmination of the topic in this volume, the distinction between what is truly human and what is merely an animal with a veneer of culture is an important one. In God Emperor we see Leto attempting to truly \u2018humanize\u2019 the race, breaking us away from an unknowing slavery to our animal instincts, which he is able to see so clearly thanks to his millennia of contemplating the inner lives of his ancestral memories. But towards (or away from) what exactly is Leto\u2019s grand plan leading humanity? What\u2019s the point? In part it seems to be away from apathy, mere safety, and the repetition of their mistakes which are constantly repeated throughout history. In part it seems to aim to protect them from some larger, perhaps external, threat that could snuff out humanity if they continue to follow the path of their natural evolution. The Bene Gesserit apparently had inklings of this knowledge, as seen in their philosophy and breeding program, but it apparently required the creation of a seemingly immortal worm-human hybrid, a true alien, to understand what was required to break humanity out from under the chains of their instinctual responses and allow them to move forward and onward to something truly new.\n\nOne other element of Herbert\u2019s Dune series that\u2019s intriguing is the seeming black and white nature of its heroes and villains which then seem to shift under our very eyes. Of course, we have the honour-bound Atreides struggling against the vile, decadent Harkonnens\u2026only to find that they are actually one and the same (genetically speaking). Our hero Paul, the young victim that witnesses the slaughter of his family and friends, becomes the instrument for the largest genocidal war in the history of humanity. Making the hero the villain and then making the villain sympathetic seems to linger behind much of the Dune series: the Atreides are the most obvious example, but there is also the Bene Gesserit who are painted as witches and masters of Machiavellian manipulation only to ultimately shine forth as guardians of humanity and heroes in later volumes. Is Leto evil? Or is he merely a paternalistic figure who can see beyond our limited vision? Was Paul evil, or was he driven by circumstances beyond his control? Is Herbert side-stepping the issue or pointing out the inherent ambiguities? I find it intriguing regardless.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nLeto II has re-made the Imperium in a bid to re-make the human race. For three and a half thousand years humanity has lived under his despotic rule, molded by seemingly undying hands that are no longer human. But remnants of the old world still linger on and the Bene Tleilax and Bene Gesserit, not to mention the technologists of Ix who skirt the edges of the Butlerian prohibitions, still hope to wrest the reins of power from the godlike worm-man Leto Atreides. In addition to this not all of the Atreides scions, produced by the god-emperor\u2019s breeding program, are content to be pawns to their illustrious and (seemingly) ever-living forebear. The spark of rebellion smolders and Herbert\u2019s wheels within wheels within wheels continue to turn. Leto would have it no other way as all appears to work towards his design. Leto is a self-proclaimed predator whose prey is humanity and his purpose is to teach them the lessons that only the cruel truths of survival can teach in the hopes that it will bring humanity out of its long adolescence that had been motivated by primal fears, myths, and instincts into a more nuanced and adult form of understanding and perceiving their universe. It is, in his words \u201c\u2026the predator\u2019s necessary cruelty.\u201d\n\nWhatever others may think of it I find this volume of the Dune series fascinating. I wonder if some of the traditional aversion to these later three volumes of the saga doesn\u2019t come from many readers\u2019 desire to have \u2018more of the same\u2019? In contravention to this, Herbert\u2019s opposed aim of developing his ideas and themes beyond the initial conditions and circumstances of the first three books can obviously frustrate expectations. We aren\u2019t in Kansas (or old style Arrakis) anymore. I have to admit that there\u2019s probably a small part of me that agrees with the dissenting voices and wishes for more of the same as well, but the other part of me is glad that Herbert resisted temptation and followed his story where it led him\u2026however far out that may have been.\n\nArrakis (no longer \u201cDune\u201d in any parlance) is now green, with the small \u2018Sareer\u2019, maintained by Leto as his refuge, as the sole remnant of the once planet-spanning desert. The Fremen have finally achieved their paradise, but at what cost? They are now known sneeringly as the \u2018\u2019Museum Fremen\u201d and exist only to perform in hollow re-enactments of their cultural traditions, traditions they no longer understand, for tourists. Leto has arranged everything in his empire according to his design, a design that is meant to bring about the \u2018golden path\u2019 for humanity, but just what does this mean? For a great part this has apparently meant an enforced tranquility and the dampening of all travel and conflict throughout the Imperium\u2026though of course, humans being humans, conflict still exists as sparks of rebellion flourish but Leto harshly puts these down with his new \u2018Fish Speaker\u2019 army of amazon warriors who are solely devoted to their god-emperor. According to Leto humanity\u2019s fatal flaw has been their reliance on the past and the patterns ingrained into them by eons of evolution. Only one such as Leto, with access to the nearly infinite memories that lay at the foundation of these instincts, can see this and force humanity out of its rut. This is Leto\u2019s golden path. A way for humanity to move beyond its heritage.\n\nLeto\u2019s golden path also hinges on a breeding plan taken, much to their chagrin, from the hands of the Bene Gesserit. Leto\u2019s aim, however, differs from theirs as he seeks a different \u2018perfection\u2019 in the Atreides genes of his descendants that veers sharply from the original goal of the kwisatz haderach. In addition to this breeding program Leto has also been serially producing gholas of Duncan Idaho. He claims to miss his old friend, but his reasons for this serial resurrection appear to go well beyond the personal. These Duncan gholas, remnants of a bygone era and forced to adapt to circumstances that are strange indeed, have a unique place in Leto\u2019s brave new world. The newest Duncan, like all of those before him, struggles with the observation \u201cthis is not Atreides\u201d as he witnesses the actions, one might say the atrocities, of the god-emperor. It brings to mind the fact that the Harkonnens and the Atreides are simply two sides of the same coin\u2026literally. Though, of course, whatever the appearances may be Leto II has only the good of the human race at heart\u2026at least that is what he avers. Aside from this overarching concern, the Duncans also have a purely personal reason for their ambivalence towards Leto. As the one we come to know quite well in this volume says himself: \u201cThere\u2019s a time, Leto, a time when you\u2019re alive. A time when you\u2019re supposed to be alive. It can have a magic, that time, while you\u2019re living it. You know you\u2019re never going to see a time like that again\u2026and [now] it\u2019s supposed to start all over again. But it doesn\u2019t. It never does, Leto. That\u2019s a crime!\u201d Duncan is truly a man out of time forced to confront realities he would never have imagined possible, especially under Atreides rule, and the psychic dissonance proves to be a hard strain on him/them.\n\nBesides Leto and Duncan there are four other characters that play a pivotal role in the story: Siona Atreides and her father Moneo, one a stalwart opponent of Leto intent on bringing down his empire no matter the cost, and the other his majordomo and right-hand man: both the products of Leto\u2019s breeding program they play key roles in his design whether they are aware of it or not; Hwi Noree, the mysterious new ambassador from Ix, whose apparently sweet nature and immediate attractiveness to the emperor may hide the seeds of his destruction; and finally Nayla the Fish Speaker, who gives fanatical devotion a face and finds herself conflicted by the very orders of her god.\n\nThe crux of the plot centers around the question of whether, after enduring millennia of his rule, the enemies of Leto II have finally managed to find the chink in his armour. Is the god-emperor at last to be brought down by an appeal to his almost vanished human nature? Will a god abandon his plan of millennia to fulfill the desires of his heart? If he does, what will be the result?\n\nThis is a very thought-provoking book with a lot to say about politics, philosophy, and religion. I might not buy everything that Herbert is selling here, but he definitely gives the reader a lot to chew on and I was pleased with this extension of the Dune universe into new and intriguing directions."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "You might love this book, you might hate it, but you definitely can't complain about this series not being full of surprises.

We've moved on thousands of years from the events of and the planet once a desert is now green with life. Leto II is still alive, but he's now ruling as a sandworm-humanoid creature with legions of Fish Soldiers over people that are growing increasingly suspicious of their ruler and his obsession with what he refers to as .\n\nI might be particularly appreciative of this now that I've read four books of the saga in which after literally thousands of pages everything feels kind of slow and repetitive, but I'm pretty sure that I have never read a series in which what would happen in the next book would be that much of a surprise. is very different to and now we're being mostly stripped of the action of the predecessor and are being served a rather philosophical and analytical novel consisting mainly of conversations between Leto II and different people of from his court.\n\nThe events of feel long ago now and we get to reminisce on earlier generations.

Detailed, rich, and dense.\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nI have to admit that I put this one on the backburner for years and years and years, even though I attempted to re-read the series several times over the decades, I always got stuck right at the end of and something in me just didn't want to pick up the two novels afterward.\n\nThis is strange to me!

And then I'll be picking up the series carried on by Anderson and Frank's son following the events of Chapterhouse.\n\nSo how did I think this book held up after all these years?\n\nPretty good! There were a few slow parts, but the one thing that Heretics does very well is the worldbuilding. The Great God Leto II has been dead for 1.5k years after taking a dip in the aqueduct, turning into sandtrout that have now become full sandworms. That means that poor Paul's son has a trapped consciousness inside these gigantic monstrosities after having lived for 5k years. (Since birth+as a sandworm+trapped consciousness.) Freaky cool. And of course, religion has a bit part to play in these books as they always have.\n\nWhat's most interesting is Miles Teg and the new Duncan Idaho. The similarities between Teg and the original Leto are pretty suggestive and the spice trance doubly so. His little transformation blew me away both times I read it. But Duncan Idaho? The obsessively resurrected clone of the original that has come back nearly countless times over 5k years? It staggers the imagination. Leto II really put him through the wringer, but even after the old god had died, the Bene Gesserit and the Bene Tlailax have turned him into the stage of their own conflict.\n\nAnd it's these two that really own the stage in this side of the universe.... until the great spreading of humanity came back. :) Enter conflict. :) So good.\n\nThis is one of those series that take a lot of dedication and understanding to really enjoy. You really have to get deep into them. But these are very, very enjoyable. This one is very complex and deep in a very similar way to the original classic.\n\nTons of politics and machinations, and if you love that, you'll love this. :)"}, {"label": "positive", "text": ""}, {"label": "positive", "text": "I had no idea that \u2018Sandworm\u2019 is a nickname for Unit 74455, a notorious Russian cybermilitary outfit. Sounds just like the kind of thing that would have pounced on humanity from the darkness of the Scattering.\n\nBy the way, this idea of the Scattering \u2013 an edge of the known universe where criminality, smuggling, rebellion, deviance, illicit tech, ideas, and people flourish \u2013 is one that both Star Trek (DS9) and Star Wars (Han Solo) have capitalised heavily on. While a lot of attention has been paid to the influence of the original \u2018Dune\u2019 on the genre, it is clear that even with \u2018Heretics\u2019 in 1985, Herbert was still planting the seeds of ideas that would impact the next generation of SF writers and artists.\n\nIf you look at the ratings and review tally for the books on Goodreads, you will see a marked drop off from \u2018Children of Dune\u2019 onwards. Yes, the sequence does technically conclude with \u2018Dune Messiah\u2019, which is a perfect point at which to stop reading if you want closure on the Paul/Muad\u2019Dib saga. While \u2018Children\u2019 was a bit of a hot mess, it did set up what is arguably the best half of the six books. And if you look at each book, they are all uniquely different.\n\nHowever, it is highly unlikely that every reader of \u2018Dune\u2019 will persevere through to \u2018Chapter House\u2019. Which is a great pity, because in my view \u2018Heretics\u2019 is the best of the sequence up to this point, a tautly plotted sociopolitical thriller that, strangely, largely consists of extended verbal jousts between the wonderfully diverse cast in a range of exotic locations, from desert to snow, and even the beguiling world of Chapter House itself. But it makes for utterly compelling reading.\n\nThis makes me think that Herbert might well be the Henry James of SF, because \u2018Heretics\u2019 is such an inward-looking chamber piece of a novel, where the sporadic bursts of violent and bloody action are all precipitated by words, glances, gestures, and the hidden intentions behind unstated meanings.\n\nWith \u2018God Emperor\u2019, the question was how to write an entire book focused on a man-sandworm hybrid that rules over the Duniverse with a tyrannical flipper. And to transform it into both a love story and a tragedy. \u2018Heretics\u2019 poses an even more interesting question: How on Rakis do you top that premise?\n\nThe opening sentence of \u2018Heretics\u2019 is one of the most arresting in the entire sequence to date: \u201cTaraza told you, did she not, that we have gone through eleven of these Duncan Idaho gholas? This one is the twelfth.\u201d (In my Gollancz paperback, this is preceded by a three-page Prologue that I see is excluded in the e-version, and which contains the famous aphorism: \u2018In the name of the Bene Gesserit Order and its Unbroken Sisterhood, this account has been judged reliable and worthy of entry into the Chronicles of the Chapter House.\u2019)\n\nReferencing the precise number of Duncan gholas to date (the character played by Jason Momoa in the 2021 adaptation of \u2018Dune: Part One\u2019 by Denis Villeneuve, for visual reference) is a neat trick of Herbert to indicate the considerable passage of time that has passed since the events of \u2018God Emperor\u2019. So much time that common names like Arrakis and Caladan have been shortened to \u2018Rakis\u2019 and \u2018Dan\u2019 respectively.\n\nAlso, the mysterious sandworms that roam the reconstituted desert of the former planet, said to each contain a pearl of the mind of Leto II, is now known as the Divided God. Sandworms, of course, are at the heart of the mythology of \u2018Heretics\u2019, which features some of Herbert\u2019s most lyrical writing about these evocative beasts.\n\nIt also seems like we have waited five books for him to use the sentence: \u201cLet sleeping worms lie\u201d, which is particularly apt as a range of factions seek \u201cto meddle with the worm-bound remnants of the Tyrant.\u201d Chief among these is the hidebound priesthood that adopts the seer Sheeana, whose lineage can be traced back to Siona in \u2018God Emperor\u2019 (and even further back to the aristocratic Atreides themselves.)\n\nSheeana, it seems, is able to communicate with the sandworms of Rakis, in accordance with an ancient prophecy from the days of Leto II about the appearance of a mysterious \u2018sandrider\u2019. You would think that everyone in the Duniverse would have had their fill of ancient prophecies by now, but alarmingly this is not the case, and so the juggernaut of history rolls on.\n\nBut the Bene Gesserit, given their secretive and reclusive nature, know a good bit of religious propaganda when they see it, and set out to investigate the claims, which sets in motion a remarkable domino of events.\n\nIf it happens to be true, they will simply incorporate Sheeana\u2019s genes into their breeding programme, referred to memorably as a Stud Book at one point. If she proves to be a fake, then it will be equally simple for the Bene Gesserit to dismiss her and trundle along their seemingly diminishing version of the Golden Path.\n\nThis would not be \u2018Dune\u2019 without it being creepy or over the top, or both. \u2018Heretics\u2019 begins with a rather queasy scene on Gammu, the former Giedi Prime, where the Reverend Mothers Schwangyu and Lucilla debate the potential sexual awakening of the latest Duncan ghola, who is on the cusp of manhood, as it were.\n\nAnother key character we are introduced to early on is Reverend Mother Taraza, whom Herbert wastes no time to highlight has already borne 19 children for the Bene Gesserit, an \u2018essential service\u2019 we are pleased to learn has not \u2018grossened\u2019 Odrade\u2019s flesh, whose full mouth \u201cpromised a passion which she was careful to bridle.\u201d\n\nRemember how Reverend Mother Mohiam was referred to as a \u2018crone\u2019 and a \u2018witch\u2019 in \u2018Dune\u2019? Well, now Herbert has gone full circle just like poor old Leto II, and gives us a supremely seductive Sisterhood that counts its sexual wiles as a key weapon in its feminine arsenal, as dangerous even as the Voice. And probably even more pointed than the Gom Jabbar.\n\nWe are informed that the Bene Gesserit \u2018speciality\u2019 is \u201cthe management of procreation and all of its attendant necessities.\u201d There is a wonderful scene near the end where Sirafa gets Lucilla\u2019s hackles up by trying to disguise her as \u201ca fifth-stage adept in the Order of Hormu.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, not only can Lucilla administer \u2018vaginal pulsing\u2019, she can control genital temperature, and arouse the 51 excitation points (the sequencing plus the combinations number 2 008), in addition to the 205 sexual positions.\n\n\n\n\nThere you have it. If you are thinking that poor Duncan has no idea what is, er, coming for him in terms of his sexual awakening at the hands of the Bene Gesserit, you are partly right. The fact that the Bene Tleilax have produced so many gholas to date must mean that they are after an elusive in their own breeding programme, just as the Sisterhood (accidentally, mind you) ended up with a Kwisatz Haderach \u2026\n\nThe Bene Gesserit are so sanctimonious in the unquestioned presumption of their own moral authority that at first they do not even comprehend the existential threat posed by the Honoured Matres, who return from the darkness and chaos of the Scattering to, well, wreak havoc. And fuck around a lot.\n\nThe fact that they might be seen as an unbridled force of creative and enabling passion leading to ultimate destruction is kind of undercut by Herbert\u2019s dodgy sexual politics coming to the fore when he has the Sisterhood constantly deriding the Honoured Matres as \u201cWhores!\u201d (Herbert even makes liberal use of the exclamation mark to emphasise this point.)\n\nApart from weaponising sex, the Scattering has also resulted in a lot of really weird tech filtering through into the Duniverse, much of it copies of, and yet infinitely superior to, Ixian manufacture. By now the monopolies on space travel by the Guild and on spice by Rakis have long been broken by technology itself, which has flowered to its full maturity in the secrecy of the Scattering, and in ways that the old Butlerian Jihad days could only have dreamed about.\n\nAnd so the stage is set for a classic confrontation in the wild sands of Rakis, a confrontation that will (again) determine the fate of the known universe."}, {"label": "neutral", "text": "Buddy read with Athena!\n\n\u201cThe surest way to keep a secret is to make someone think they already know the answer.\u201d\n\nThe tyrant God Emperor has returned to the sands of Dune.

The most powerful of these forces are the Honored Matres, a violent society of women bred and trained for combat and the sexual control of men.\n\n\u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634 \u0631\u0648\u0632 \u0628\u06cc\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u06cc\u06a9\u0645 \u0645\u0627\u0647 \u0641\u0648\u0631\u06cc\u0647 \u0633\u0627\u0644 2019 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc\n\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0628\u062f\u0639\u062a\u06af\u0630\u0627\u0631 \u062a\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0633\u0647\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646\u06a9 \u0647\u0631\u0628\u0631\u062a\u061b\n\u0627. \u0634\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc"}, {"label": "neutral", "text": "I\u2019m one of those weirdos that actually likes the entirety of Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune series even after you get past the first three volumes and the direct history of Muad\u2019Dib and his family and start wading into some seriously weird stuff (and saying that the later volumes of the series are weird when you compare them to the earlier ones is saying something). Don\u2019t worry though, I\u2019m not crazy enough to have anything but contempt for that cash grab series of prequels and sequels floated by Herbert\u2019s son and his ghost writer pal\u2026blech! Part of the interest for me in the later volumes is seeing how the prescience of Muad\u2019Dib (and even more so of his son the god-emperor Leto II) affected the human race and noting how humanity responded in an attempt to free themselves from the \u2018Golden Path\u2019 that it brought about. The other reason, I must admit, is that I find the character of Duncan Idaho, or more precisely the Duncan Idaho gholas which populate these books, fascinating. Be warned: there are some spoilerific details for previous volumes of the original Dune series below.\n\nIn the previous volume we got a close-up view of the tyranny of the man-worm himself, the god-emperor Leto II (all done for humanity\u2019s own good of course) and also saw his fascination with bringing back his family\u2019s old retainer, the inimitable sword master Duncan Idaho again and again in ghola form over a period of centuries. Why Duncan Idaho? What\u2019s so special about him? And why did Leto keep bringing him back (and ultimately killing him) over and over again? Was he expecting some result other than companionship and ultimately betrayal? It appears to have been a question the sisters of the Bene Gesserit started asking themselves as well and once they were free from the direct yoke of the god-emperor (though not of his pre-destined plan for humanity), they decided to keep up the tradition for themselves and see what the result might be.\n\nAnd so we begin this volume of the series at a Bene Gesserit fortress located on the planet Gammu (formerly Geidi Prime, home of both the Harkonnens and the original Duncan Idaho) watching as a young ghola is being trained for purposes that even his teachers and protectors aren\u2019t fully aware of. Of course this ghola is merely the last in a long line of Duncan Idahos, not yet aware of his previous existence, and just as uncertain of his purpose as those who watch over him. Despite the fact that this book takes place thousands of years after the time of Muad\u2019Dib some familiar features survive: as noted the Bene Gesserit are still controlling bloodlines (though with the express purpose to perfect human breeding while at the same time to explicitly avoid the appearance of another Kwitsatz Haderach) and holding a precarious, though powerful, position in the political hegemony of human culture in the former precincts of the Padishah Empire; the Bene Tleilax still tinker with the genetic code of humanity in a much more direct way (including supplying the Bene Gesserit with their desired Duncan Idaho gholas) and hope to supersede all political rivals through plans and machinations of their own; and the Spacing Guild and industrialists of Ix still survive albeit in much weakened forms. Two of the most drastic changes are that the Bene Tleilax have finally discovered a way to artificially produce the spice melange and thus break the stranglehold previously held by those who controlled the Worms of Arrakis (or Rakis as it is now called); not to mention the fact that a multitude of peoples who had left the Empire after the fall of the god-emperor in an event called the Scattering to populate the vast reaches of space are now returning and want to conquer all of the supposed secrets of the humans they left behind in the regions of the old empire.\n\nThe overarching tale is one of political intrigue as the Bene Gesserit face off against the mysterious Bene Tleilax and each hopes to outplay the other in a bid to control the former empire; of course in addition to this they both face the threat of the nearly overwhelming forces of the Scattering and their mysterious and deadly leaders, the Honored Matres. At a much more human level it is the personal story of several key players against this wider backdrop: the Duncan Idaho ghola as he comes into his own and must decide how to live in this new world separated from all he knew by thousands of years; his teacher and mentor Miles Teg, an Atreides scion and mentat-warrior of great ability who has served the Bene Gesserit all of his life; Sheanna, a young native of Rakis apparently born with the power to control the sand worms into which the god-emperor transformed himself; and Darwe Odrade a sister of the Bene Gesserit who must navigate difficult waters and test her loyalty to the sisterhood that made her and the many plans within plans that have formed the basis of her society.\n\nI enjoyed this volume, though I think on this re-read I didn\u2019t find it quite as captivating as I remember my first reading to have been. This also is very much the first half of one story as it ends nearly in mid-crisis and leaves much to be resolved in the next volume (which I remember being the weirdest of the bunch and which itself unfortunately left many unanswered questions). If you want to keep following Frank Herbert on the ride through his crazy Dune universe and see the impact of the Atreides on the human race then this is a required volume; on the other hand if you were happy to leave things where they were at the end of , or found the politics and world of confounding then perhaps you should leave this one on the shelf."}, {"label": "neutral", "text": "Premise: 1000-plus years after the regime of Leto II, human races had spread across the known galaxies and beyond, with the godlike tyrant (Leto II) out of the picture, different races and power groups/religious groups now ruled different parts and corners of the different civilizations, and the power struggle and scheme continued.\n\nI enjoy the first four books of the Dune series, but by the fifth book, I must admit something in the story is getting old. I mean, you can only reuse the idea of weird breeding program, court intrigue, characters hiding and giving chase in the desert etc etc that many times.\n\nPlus, hardly any character stand out in the book. The main characters are a reasonable enough bunch but they just aren't very remarkable, as to the 'villains'.........they are even more unmemorable. For example, in book 4 I can always see Leto II clearly but in this book, I can't picture any of the characters as a lively being and the ideal they stand for, in my mind. *sighs*\n\nFurthermore, what I really don't like about this volume is, the slut shaming is getting really much, I mean, the Bene Geserit had been using sex as weapon for god know how long, but when there is a bunch of newcomers coming along, also using sex to control men (okay, as usual homosexuality is not mentioned), said newcomers were labeled as sluts nonstop, I mean, come on.\n\nPS: I also don't think this volume brings much insight for its readers, but I will read the next book anyway."}, {"label": "neutral", "text": "3.5\u2b50\ufe0f\ud83d\ude2c"}, {"label": "neutral", "text": "Heretics of Dune\n(Dune #5)\nby Frank Herbert\nNew characters but very interesting!

time after the rule of God Emperor Leto II. When I say a long time, I mean one thousand five hundred years after the rule of Leto II Atreides (that also lasted for a rather long time). In that sense, the universe it describes is quite different. As a reader, you need to be aware of that books five and six in the series are somewhat different from the rest.\n\nThe previous novel covered a long period of time (3, 500 years long reign of Leto II) , but it was a time dominated by a single man/god/tyrant so it was pretty monotonous (even if very interesting from some points of view). In contrast, the world of Heretics of Dune is full of unknown. You could even say that this book requires some imagination and patience from its reader. It demands of its reader to understand the Golden Path and its implications. Still, there are many familiar players. You could say that the known world is reverting to its old Dune ways, for example with the spice remaining as important as ever). The Bene Gesserit are stepping on the stage again. The sisterhood is perhaps the only force that is fully aware of the golden path. However, they might struggle with deciding on their role. The sisterhood must evolve or perish.\n\nHeretics of Dune witnesses humanity in a new light, no longer imprisoned by Leto II's rule but rather walking on the Golden Path. Even if nobody is really sure what the future will bring, it seems that emperor Leto's plan to save humanity from destruction has worked out- at least to an extent. By imprisoning the human race under his rule for more than three thousand years, Leto II caused humans to 'go boldly forward where no man has gone before' i.e. the Scattering- his plan all along. The human kind has scattered into space we are made to see- but we are not shown what it really means, but rather as readers we are invited to ask some questions ourselves. Moreover, as this novel opens some of the scattered are coming back- and they do not hold much love for the Old Empire. The Honored Matres, a violent female organization that enslaves males sexually so it could control them, seek to destroy the sisterhood and just about anyone who opposes them. The Honored Matres are extremely dangerous and violent, so drunk on power that they are willing to turn entire planets into dust on any provocation.\n\nHeretics of Dune is closely tied to its sequel Chapterhouse: Dune. Don't expect a clean ending in this one. Many of the subplots will be develop in the following novel. This novel introduces us to a new Dune universe that will be expanded (but possibly not fully explained) in the final novel. There are many interesting characters in this novel. Like its sequel, the emphasis is on female characters, with the exception of Miles Teg and Duncan Idaho.\n\nThe leather of Bene Gesserit in this novel is Taraza, a strong Mother Superior who seems to always be one step ahead of others. A Fremen girl Sheena who learns that she can control the worms will became an important figure once Bene Gesserit gets hold of her as well. As always, there are Atreides characters. Miles Tag, the genius military strategist working for the sisterhood and his unorthodox daughter Odrade. Taraza and Odrade become closely associated, known under nicknames Tar and Dar, despite doubts that sisterhood places in Odrade who remains something of a romantic.\n\n\n\nI found this novel a fascinating and a quick read. The events take place quite quickly and the plot makes sense. Miles Teg, in particular, was a very dynamic and interesting character. However, perhaps I enjoyed the sequel to Heretics of Dune a bit more than this book, just because it was a bit more philosophical. Moreover, in the final book, there is a more detailed analysis of power, government and Bene Gesserit. Still, I would recommend this one just as much. These two novels would be really hard to understand one without the other. It is always best to read the Dune books (I mean the original Frank Herbert series) in the chronological order, that is, the way they were published- and especially so with these two. In some sense, Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse: Dune feel like the same novel to me, perhaps because they feature almost the same set of characters. Apart from those characters that are killed or perish, all the main characters repeat in the sequel Chapterhouse: Dune, so these two novels are definitely closely connected. I recommend taking on the sequel right after you finish Heretics of Dune, or you could forget some important details. To conclude, this is another novel in the Dune series that I enjoyed immensely."}, {"label": "negative", "text": "After the long philosophical rambling disguised as a novel that was the last book, I hadn't much interest in continuing the series. Yet, the trailer came out for the new Dune movie, and I had a choice, reread the first Dune novel or continue the series. With only two books left written by the father, it seemed a shame to leave it unfinished. I chose to continue the series, and feel like this, as well as the series after the first, were both mistakes.\n\nThere is little doubt in my mind the first Dune book(which was meant to be a trilogy in of itself) was meant to be the only book. Messiah was still good, if unnecessary. I remember not disliking Children of Dune, except for the ending. God Emperor was just barely above a one star review, and this book, while better, made me sad. The grand vision that was Dune seems like little more than a money grab to me now. In my heart, the series isn't a series at all but a single novel that ended with Paul as emperor and the knowledge of the Jihad to come.\n\nWell, I guess I could talk a bit about this book specifically now that my morose ramblings are at an end. The characters were pretty decent, the most memorable ones since the first book. Other than that though, I was bored and slightly appalled throughout. It's quite obvious things are made up as he goes along, and ideas conflict with earlier ideas in the previous books.\n\nThe whole sex addiction making slaves of an empire comes across as little more than silly fetishism to me and doesn't work in my mind. Humanity is and has never been, an entirely sexual nor heterosexual species. The idea that sex can be so damn good with these women, that any man that has it is a slave for life made me grimace.\n\nThere were plot conveniences throughout. Seemingly insurmountable enemies were suddenly given a glaring weakness, or the good guys were just as suddenly given an unexpected power or ally. The ending in particular was rife with convenient escapes.\n\nNow, there are flashes of that original Dune brilliance, some neat quotes and ideas here and there. Plus, as I said, the characters were well done for the most part. Everything else though, made it hard to finish this book. Will I read the final Frank Herbert Dune book? Probably, it seems almost silly to stop here, but I really wish he had stopped with Dune. Some prequel novels might have been fun, but that's really all I can see being necessary.

On this, my finally-got-through-it complete reading of Heretics, I realized that last time I tried to read it, I stalled out 70 pages from the end -- that's how much of a grind these books can be.\n\nBut unlike the first four volumes, I don't really have the same sense of reward or accomplishment at finishing this one. Like most of the other books, Herbert doesn't really reveal what the book is about until the last fifteen pages or so. Most of the book follows two groups of characters on the run, each protecting a Chosen One from the evil powers that wish to destroy them. Throughout the book, each group repeatedly escapes some offscreen threat and then argues amongst themselves about the next course of action before a new threat emerges, at which point Herbert cuts away to the other group just as the action starts. And, as with most of the other books, Herbert is far more interested in these in-between moments of discussion, usually between characters with various levels of prescience that are each trying to outwit the other. However, Herbert is uninterested -- almost to a fault -- in describing action. Most of the time this just means he's playing to his strengths, but in (especially in its final pages, where most of the plot takes place), so much happens in the space between chapters, paragraphs, and even sentences that the reader is often playing a frustrating amount of catch up. It's also just a drag to spend 200-300 pages setting up a story that unfolds most of its most important ideas in the last three chapters.\n\nSo structurally, there's much to be desired. Herbert likes a slow burn, but the psychological tension, use of language, or simply the espousal of philosophy is typically the real draw anyway. Unfortunately, is also just sort of criminally stupid in terms of what it actually focuses on. For example, the plots and themes of the first four novels are about the nature of political power, of the limitations of human will and its relation to time and society.\n\nHowever, is about two competing sects of sex nuns. The Good sex nuns are trying to protect one of the Chosen Ones from the bad sex nuns, who are a threat because they are better at full body orgasms. The twist is that this Chosen One is even better at full body orgasms, and therefore the Good sex nuns have to come up with a new plan for how to harness his uncontrollable sex powers.\n\nThere's also some culturally insensitive stuff about Islam that completely undoes everything about religion that Herbert handled more thoughtfully in the previous books, but it doesn't really matter because in the end everyone in that part of the book is either dead or having sex with the sex nuns.\n\nThis is, really-I-am-not-kidding, the whole plot of this book for the first 445 pages. In the last 25 pages, it changes into an entirely different book that is actually interesting and not something you are embarrassed to type in a Goodreads review, but most of THAT happens offscreen and is described in a serious of rhetorical questions in the last 4 pages.\n\nAlso Herbert manages to throw in some digs at (deserved) and fancy restaurants (like, he is very angry with restaurants for some reason).\n\nAnyway, I don't even fucking know with this book. There is a giant penis on the front cover that is even more of a giant penis than the giant penises on the other books. That's probably all you need to know.\n\nAlso happy new year."}, {"label": "negative", "text": "I loved the Dune Chronicles 1-4. Especially the God Emperor of Dune was fantastic. I was shocked that Heretics of Dune was so boring I almost gave up on it. I read on because I wanted to see whether it would get any better, but no, it didn't.\n\nI'm just really confused. Who is the main character? There's lots of characters, but most of them felt like bland supporting characters to me. The few interesting ones didn't get enough screen time to become central in the plot. Teg came the closest to becoming the main character, but he lacked the charisma. Everybody kept saying how awesome he is, but he didn't actually do anything awesome. He's a Mentat, and yet he got out of the one hairy situation not by using his wits, but by suddenly developing inexplicable superpowers. Majorly disappointing.\n\nAnd what is this book even about? I kept waiting for the plotline to kick in, but I just didn't see it. It seems that the whole point was just to (SPOILER ALERT) get one sandworm off Rakis (a feat that turned out to be laughably easy, apparently). But if that was the climax, why the heck did it happen off screen? The moment something interesting was about to happen it was skipped over. Instead we got loads of descriptions of characters sitting around, feeling awfully distressed about the danger they were supposedly in. Descriptions of childhoods.

I pored toga ovo je jedan neverovatno dobar deo, a koji to nije, Hronika Dine i sa velikim zadovoljstvom ali i po malo tuzan prelazim na poslednji deo ovog malo je reci monumentalnog serijala."}, {"label": "neutral", "text": "[Nota Bene: As Frank Herbert's last two published novels in the Dune series, Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse: Dune, along with the unwritten Dune 7, in fact comprise a single story that happened to be divided into three parts, I'll post the same review for both of the two published volumes. This review contains no spoilers.]\n\nDuring the first half of his literary career, Frank Herbert focused most on coming to terms with what it meant to be conscious. The evolution of his thinking on the subject can be traced from real-world events which happened to him in his youth, through his earliest published science fiction stories, crude as they were, and on into novels like and the stories that would coalesce into , and certainly and . This line of thinking reached its fruition in the novels and .\n\nHaving expanded his understanding of the full spectrum of consciousness about as far as it could go (although admittedly he never stopped tinkering with the subject), in the second half of his career Herbert refocused his attention on how the limitations imposed upon individual consciousness \u2013 or perhaps it might be better to say the limited perspective encompassing a single human lifetime \u2013 leaves humanity ill-equipped to confront an infinite and ever-changing universe. In effect we end up in a continuous crisis mode, always vainly insisting that the world of tomorrow conform to the expectations of yesterday. We're persistently and comically always shocked to discover our assumptions are wrong. Elsewhere I have described this aspect of Herbert's thinking, the human failure to deal with, or even to recognize, the implications of an unbounded universe, as an . This theme begins to emerge in and is especially prominent in , for a final surmounting of the absolute-infinity breach is the primary target of Leto II's Golden Path. But we also encounter the concern in Herbert's final trilogy: , , and (by implication) in the unwritten .\n\nIt is a hallmark of Herbert's imagination that he pursues an ever-elaborating expanse of concerns, always tracing a spectral pathway across a continuum of broadening bandwidth, chasing after considerations of widening implications across grander and grander scales of magnitude. An original interest in a fleeting moment of hyperconsciousness ultimately led Herbert into defining consciousness, hyperconsciousness and subconsciousness in all their aspects and dramatizing what he had learned and concluded in his stories; likewise his contemplations of the diverse implications of the absolute-infinity breach. And it might be added that he pushed his spectral analytical approach through time as well, so the saga becomes probably the most temporally discontinuous series ever written. The first three novels take place roughly around the year 21,200 AD. The drama of unfolds 3,500 years later, and that of the last three books ( and are difficult novels, and attempting to distinguish them as separate novels, or independent from the unwritten , is an artificial and arbitrary exercise) takes place an additional 1,500 years after that, placing us circa 26,200 AD.\n\nAs the primary goal of and was to shatter the innate mythmaking in humanity that compels us to conservative convergence, these last three books are intended to unveil the consequences of living in a multiverse that has become irreparably divergent. This divergence followed in the wake of the downfall of the God Emperor and the subsequent Scattering of humanity not throughout multiple star systems or galaxies, but across multiple universes which are discontinuous with one another. Any threat can now come upon our heroes and heroines from any direction, but with all the eggs no longer in one basket, no matter what catastrophe might befall locally, the whole story can never come to a final end.\n\nIn (1984) and (1985), the Bene Gesserit has recovered substantially from the tribulation of the era of the God Emperor, and now we're allowed a far more intensive view of the inner workings of the Sisterhood than ever before. But the Bene Gesserit and the remnants of the old Imperium, as ever, are confronted by a host of power-hungry enemies, new and old, in the usual style of Herbert's Machiavellian plotting. It is these plots-within-plots that seemingly all other reviewers have focused on, and I'll forego doing the same here.\n\nHerbert said it wasn't until he was writing that he came to understand that an important role of an author was to entertain his readership. That will come as surprising news to some of you who like Herbert, and not to some of you who don't. But it's important to note that the word \"entertainment\" carries different connotations for readers than it does for hacks or more seriously-aspiring authors. Entertainment is something that is doled out to the action-adventure-thriller crowd, to those who love reading or going to the movies in no small part for the sheer escapism of the thing. Now I'm not overly bigoted about this. There's nothing more boring than a book that's, well, boring. But I think what Herbert was getting at was that as he matured as a writer he came to see, as many writers do, that plot is less interesting than character, no matter how many car chases or lasgun exchanges are involved.\n\nI for one can't separate a reading of the last books of the series from knowledge of what was going on in Herbert's life as he wrote them, which he did, by that way, at an absolutely furious pace. This happened to be during the most stressful part of his entire life. His wife, Beverly, had been dying for ten years, and the last two years of her life were especially painful for her and for her husband, both physically and emotionally. I believe that, had he lived, Frank Herbert would have easily written the novel to complete the series. I am less sanguine that he could ever have written another coherent novel after that one.\n\nBy the time was published in 1981, and with the signed contracts for the later novels in hand, Herbert was financially secure but, as I've suggested, he was suffering from increasing emotional instability. Furthermore, I can't help believing he was struck by a supreme irony, which is that, like Paul Maud'Dib, he now found himself hemmed in by the conservative mythology of his own image which he himself had created. To this day you can still see this in reviews of his later books, wherein readers who were born after Herbert's death still bemoan the fact that his later books are not like in style. Everyone wanted, and continues to want, Frank Herbert to write books that seem like quote-unquote Frank Herbert books: everyone wanted, and wants, Herbert to remain frozen unchanging in 1965. But in his later years Herbert, with his financial security, felt free to try to break out of that myth regardless of the demands and expectations of his fans, and for this I applaud him. I'm sure he did have basic plot elements in mind for the last three books of the series \u2013 call this the \"entertainment\" necessary to bring the masses along \u2013 but it's quite obvious that he had already grown more interested in character development than in weaving such masterful webs of palace intrigue anymore.\n\nHerbert wanted to change course, but he had not yet found a new direction. I see hints of this in , in which Duncan Idaho tells Alia about the practice of setting out blocks of marble in the desert to be etched by the blowing sand of a Coriolis storm. Idaho argues that the sculpted pieces produced are beautiful but they are not art, as they are not carved according to human volition. But in the latter books it is Sheeana who creates an abstract sculpture she calls \"The Void,\" which is art. How might these two kinds of sculpture compare? What is the symbolic significance of Sheeana's abstract work? The question is particularly relevant, it seems to me, when Sheeana's piece is recognized as a symbol set in tension with a Van Gogh which, at the end of is carted off into a new, uncharted universe. Clearly, I think, the matter can be read as a form of self-psychoanalysis undertaken by the author. \"The Void\" is the primitive and unformed new expression welling up inside him; the old and familiar, even conventional Van Gogh has been let slip away with a fond farewell.\n\nA kind of quantum uncertainty pervades and which are, after all, a single story occupying multiple volumes. We do not have enough pieces to interpret this story or to fairly critique its parts, which must therefore remain finally unadjudicated and unjudgeable. This is because the unwritten was also to have comprised a full third of the complete tale. We can see that Herbert was bending writing to a new direction, and we can hazard some educated guesses about (entertaining) plot elements that would have informed the third book, but we can never know. The best we can do is ponder any written records or notes that Herbert may have left behind as poles in the sand to mark the path he intended to follow. Anyone who possesses any such notes, it seems to me, can be a good steward to the memory of Frank Herbert only by publishing them in unexpurgated form: lacking that, Herbert's career accomplishments can never be properly assessed. And that is an injustice to an important 20th century American writer."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "The fifth novel of the Dune series takes place 1,500 years after the events of \"God Emperor of Dune\".

God Emperor of Dune was too heavy with little action to break it up, and besides, it was so hard to visualise Leto II as the hybrid creature he became. Heretics of Dune however is a big return to form, with lots of action and different character focus, combined with the mysticism, religion and philosophical discourse that characterises this whole series of novels. This is why I gave this top marks, as it is a page turner and, like the other four books, makes you think about things.\n\nThe setting this time is one thousand years after Leto II's death which would be nearly five thousand years after the original trilogy- I mean, Frank Herbert was certainly not conservative with dating his fiction was he? This time, the Bene Gesserit are the books main focus, with their wheeling and dealings, their breeding program all playing a major role. Also, there is actually some *sex* in this book, which was pretty erotic to say the least. About time too. Leto II's Golden Path is reaching its culmination as well, and yes, Duncan Idaho is still reincarnated as a Ghola yet again.\n\nDune, I am slowly realising, is a classic set of novels - well written and philosophical, dealing with religion, mysticism, martial arts, feminism and a whole spectrum of contemporary issues, despite the fact that these books were written from the mid 1960's to the mid 1980's - and still deal with modern subjects that are as important today as they were back then.

Arrakis is now called Rakis and has become a desert planet again. As planned by Leto, his death spawned the resurgence of sandworms (able to thrive when the desert took over again). While his death resulted in the hope that spice will be flowing once again, it has also triggered a kind of exodus, called the Scattering, when the Empire crumbled.\nDominant powers in what is left of the Empire are the Bene Gesserit, the Ixians (inventors pushing the boundaries of what is technologically allowed ever since the Butlerian Jihad, thus developing (amongst other things) the no-ships which are invisible to detection), and Bene Tleilax (an isolationist group of genetic manipulators that have developed the axlotl tank in which the gholas are being bred and in which they can now produce spice even; they have also developed a new form of face dancers). Manipulators one and all and all of them strangely \u2026 weak now.\nThe ones who left the Empire are called the Lost Ones. Most powerful amongst them are the Honoured Matres - an off-shoot of the Bene Gesserit that, while having peculiar powers, also seem to have devolved from the Sisterhood: they have lost the ability to absolutely control their bodies and emotions. Nevertheless, they should not be underestimated.\n \nSimultaneously, it has come to the Bene Gesserit's attention that there is a young woman on Rakis that can control the sandworms (Sheeana\n, as is only to be expected, causes mayhem amongst the fish speakers that have turned into priests on Rakis as people start worshipping her like they used to worship Muad'Dib).\nPerhaps it is therefore no coincidence that the Lost Ones are returning now of all times, bent on conquest.\nThe Bene Gesserit have foreseen this conflict and prepared accordingly despite the Sisterhood being divided internally. Thus, another Duncan Idaho ghola has been bred and is being trained while they are also keeping tabs on Sheeana. Another asset in their struggle for supremacy is a former military commander, (Bashar) Miles Teg (\n). Darwi Odrade, one of his daughters (biological, unbeknown to him), is a Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit and sent to Rakis to take over the keep there.\n \nSo yes, all forces are converging on Dune.

Discovering the richness of the plot yourself is half the fun of reading these books after all.\n\nSeriously, I had my doubts about how I'd like these last two books after how volume 4 ended (what could possibly come after that, especially since there was nobody left for me to connect with).\nI should have trusted the author more.\nJust seeing the Atreidis legacy, all the consequences even from small actions from about 5000 years earlier - it all brought home just how big the threat to humanity was and why such drastic sacrifices were necessary to ensure the Golden Path would be followed ... or did something happen that thwarted Leto's plans?\n \nAs predicted, I didn't connect too much with most characters here.

It is written fast and Herbert lost himself or it was just like that so he can make part 6, i think the second option is more realistic. Another important notice for me that Heretics of Dune lost spiritual and mystical side which previous books all had it and it was one of the aspects why i fell in love so deeply with the whole Dune universe. The Heretics of Dune is more on political intrigue side mixed with action parts of the charachter Miles Teg and strange sexuality.

How do you follow up a masterpiece that is GEoD. Well, no matter it was always going to disappoint if I had those expectations however I did not, so I didn\u2019t feel disappointed. If anything, I was surprised by the additions to the series. As it gives a more in-depth look into behind the scenes of the series in particular with the Bene Gesserit. We have been wondering so much about their involvement, but now we are understanding their upbringing, procedure, and general thought process of this sisterhood. What surprised me most was probably the character work displayed for the sisterhood.\n\nI really enjoyed reading about Taraza and Odrade in particular. These two individuals are particularly close. This creates this interesting dynamic because of what we know about the sisterhood and their stances to certain emotions in particular love. It's interesting how Lady Jessica actions in pre-Dune have significantly impacted the way BG, how they condition its members. Jessica is that living reminder of love being a bad thing as from that Paul came to power then Leto II which was the tyrant dictator that was not pleasant for them to say the least. Even though this is not a sequel in a traditional sense, the effects of Leto II reign can still be felt throughout the galaxy. One thing the other Dune sequels never provided is seeing how Leto reign would impact other civilisations we see small glimpses here. They a reason why I think Herbert is the second-best world-building in fiction behind Tolkien and continues that trend. The sense of the history of Rakis, the culture that developed that grew or regressed in certain elements like God emperor is awesome to read upon. We not only get much more development of BG but furthermore, we get the deeper motivations of Tleilax. Which is the knowledge we wanted to know since Messiah to God Emperor what is their goal. I would probably admit this is probably the weakest POV character (well second or 3rd weakest) by far in this book. I didn\u2019t care about Master Waff compared to every other POV character. However, that stated Waff has some interesting conversations with BG and Honored Matres.\n\nThough I readily admit I was disappointed with the Honored Matres I did not care about them. Like their motivation and power can come across as juvenile even BG consistently calling them whore lol. Unsure what Herbert mindset was when developing these figures, they obviously pose a big threat but feel like the biggest jokes on occasions. I think the empathises of sex being their weapon just came across as silly.\n\nAnyways talking about reoccurring faces well Duncan is back and I enjoyed his plotline once again. I do think this time Frank has addressed a certain criticism of Duncan character consistently gets in this instalment which I enjoyed.\n\n\nTeg is probably the best-written character in this novel which is funny as it's basically a Leto. Throughout the Dune Saga, the idea of free will is consistently being debated especially with Prescience. With the character of Teg and Odrade, the idea of free will is explored quite throughout especially with the two-character backstories of what is pre-determined and what is free will. They are also political topics its addresses which get boring for this review but I liked the way it handles certain topics. Leadership however I talk about briefly it's interesting to see how leadership portrayed in the Dune Saga we talked as a general monarchy to slowly transitioning to something else.\n\nAnyways let's briefly discuss character work. This is a particular field I expected to be quite bare-bones and straight-up bad. However, It's Dune and Frank is a good writer so he great at making distinct characters quite fast. Odrade introduction this is the most apparently you already feel for the character pretty early on with discussions. Anyways I hope to talk about each individual character, but I just state it better than I suspected. However, that said I believe Dune 1-4 has superior character work. One advantage those novels had is well it's one story, so they are reoccurring faces this is a start to a new story altogether. Another Strength is politics, the Dune Saga tackles this with extreme care. The first 40% felt like the original Dune in that regard. It was probably my favourite section in Heretics which was the scheming. Frank is amazing at doing it. Those plans within plans and intelligent characters trying to outwit or outclass the other. It can be boring for some, but I love it.\n\nThough I think it's best to be aware this novel is far more space opera than philosophy science fiction as Dune 1-4. Of course, it still has that intact but it's a more straightforward narrative than any of the Dune novels. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad thing just it's very different. The Cons to this type of storytelling for me is that I never been the biggest fan of Herbert action sequences. Like I love the novels but how action is described never really grabbed me. Except one sequence in Dune and I love the beginning of God Emperor. That said like the other novels its still minimal but more action than the rest of the series.\n\nYou're probably curious about the flaws of the novel. Well, I already highlighted some like the Honored Matres and regarding the use of sex for them. But my biggest one has to come to the climax of the novel.\nTo end with positive I think the ending is excellent and fitting.\n\n\n\nIn Conclusion, over time I have kinda been back and forth but ultimately this is a good novel. Unsure if this is the sequel that people wanted but I liked my time being in this interesting world. Though God Emperor felt like an ending this does follow up God Emperor nicely by being quite distant to not undermine that story. In certain ways, it's more of a sequel than I expected but, in another sense, it's also a different story altogether. Maybe the word would be it\u2019s a thematically a sequel? I know this is a first of an incomplete trilogy but honestly If you are coming in knowing that you should be fine. I think this novel alone is worth reading just because how it enhances the stories before and the one its telling is compelling."}, {"label": "negative", "text": "Muazzam ba\u015flayan Dune serisi bence ilk \u00fc\u00e7 kitab\u0131n \u00f6tesine ge\u00e7memeliymi\u015f. \u00c7\u00fcnk\u00fc d\u00f6rd\u00fcnc\u00fc ciltte ba\u015flayan irtifa kayb\u0131, be\u015finci ciltte \u00e7ak\u0131lma emareleri g\u00f6stermi\u015f.

I remember being sort of disappointed by the turn of events and the fact that Herbert had abandoned the Atreides family, but has he?\n\nIn \"Heretics of Dune\", the spotlight is taken by the Bene Gesserit, the misterios sisterhood who controls from the shadows the empire's religious ad political life and aims to attain, by careful gene selection, a path of enlightenment for all humanity. After Leto II's death, they took over, to some extent, his Golden Path, but their work is hindered by the Bene Tleilax, who have their own goals to resurrect the \"only true religion\" and the Scattering elements, especially the so-called Honored Matres, a twisted reflection of the Bene Gesserit. On Dune, now called Rakis, a girl who can control the sand worms appears - a new element that, together with the ever-resurrected ghola Duncan Idaho, can help the Bene Gesserit with their ultimate goal.\n\n\"Heretics\" is probably the most action-packed volume of the series, so far. Yes, even more so that \"Dune\". The 600 pages encompass a lot of politics - as one would expect from Frank Herbert's universe -, but also action scenes, fighting, escaping tight situations, sex (too much, to be honest). This instalment has a more \"action movie\" feeling that any of the other volumes, quite cinematic also - Herbert's descriptions of the surroundings and the character's actions are so detailed sometimes that one could easily place themselves in the middle of the events.\n\nAs this volume expands on the Dune universe and delves more into the two opposing religios forces - the Bene Gesserit and Bene Tleilax, Herbert brings forward a handful of memorable characters from both sides. By far, my favorite is Miles Teg, a Bashar Mentat who is a descendant of the Atreides and as such discovers powers beyond what is considered normal. I've always been partial to the Atreides' morality and his resemblance to Leto only made Teg more endearing to me. Duncan Idaho's reappearance is exciting in itself, but even more so with the new \"abilities\" that the Tleilaxu have added to this new version.\n\nThis is a bit of a space opera thriller, and it is thrilling, without doubt. Also a bit too long for my taste, though - I found myself getting lost here and there and anxious for it to get to the point already (or maybe I'm just not all that into long books anymore). My main issue though (which did not take away from the fun of this novel, I know, weird) is the way Herbert treated women; he was a bit of a sexist and it got too much at some point with all the sexual plot).\n\nTo me, its main merit is bringing the two Bene organizations into the spotlight, with their politics, social constructions and religios approaches. Some things (especially regarding the Tleilaxu) are cleared regarding their organization and motivations, and the Bene Gesserit's ultimate goal is mind-blowing.

This one had the same mass volume of intrigue that Herbet always serves up so well but there was also a butt ton of action in this installment as well.

In we got equal parts action and intrigue which added a level of adrenaline fueled reading that I love but I'm not used to in these books.

Something that has become clearer to me as I\u2019ve read through the Dune series again this time has been the fact that Herbert\u2019s greatest strength in all of them may lie in his characters with which he has a deft hand. It is most often because of them, I think, that I find the Dune series worth reading even when some other aspects of it may seem as though they are coming off the rails a bit. That and the intriguing ideas of course. Not only does Herbert posit an intriguing society based on some far-out sf-nal ideas, but he lods them with musings on politics, religion, and basic human nature that make them well worth the price of admission. Politics and religion are still dominant themes in this volume, but one thing really stands out: sex. Not to say this is an explicit book, but the power and motivation of sex as a lever to hold others in sway is certainly central.\n\nAnd guess who\u2019s back? That\u2019s right, our old friend Duncan Idaho has been resurrected yet again in ghola form, this time to serve the purposes of the newly resurgent Bene Gesserit Order who appear as fascinated by the Atreides\u2019 old swordmaster as nearly everyone else in the Dune universe. 1500 years have passed since the fall of the god-emperor, though his presence is still felt, and his golden path continues to steer humanity along the tracks he has set for them. Between the end of the last volume and our present one humanity has suffered a massive collapse due to the fall of Leto\u2019s empire which resulted not only in the Famine Times, but also in a subsequent mass exodus of humanity known as the Scattering. Now the prodigal brothers and sisters, a mass of humanity that dwarfs the numbers of those left in the core worlds, are returning home and the spectre of war threatens all of humanity.\n\nAfter four previous volumes we finally begin to get a glimpse into the inner workings of some of the most mysterious elements of Herbert\u2019s mythology: namely the Bene Gesserit and the Bene Tleilax. Perhaps the most horrific revelation is the one made about the Tleilaxu axlotl tanks which have been key to producing the much-desired Duncan Idaho gholas, the allure of which (whom?) also seem tantalizingly close to finally receiving an answer. The danger in this kind of revelation, of course, is that it may not live up to one\u2019s hopes. I think Herbert does a pretty good job in avoiding that trap, though, and he still manages to keep making his expanding and changing Dune universe interesting and surprising. There is at least one old lesson that it appears the universe at large *still* hasn\u2019t sufficiently learned even after the example of the god-emperor: don\u2019t fuck with the Atreides! Even latter-day scions of the family like Darwi Odrade and Miles Teg have the genetic heritage to fuck you up!\n\nIn this volume I\u2019d say that the aforementioned new characters of Miles Teg and Darwi Odrade really shine, and Duncan Idaho is one of my perennial favourites so I\u2019m happy to see him once again. We even get a new glimpse of the seemingly ubiquitous character by witnessing much more of his pre-Idaho personality as embodied in a ghola that is still quite young and being trained by the Bene Gesserit in preparation for awakening his old memories and personality. If I was going to point to anything that felt like a weakness in the book it might be something you could call \u2018GRR Martin Syndrome\u2019: namely, that while I was captivated by at least half of the storylines Herbert weaves in this book, I found some others to be a little less interesting. Even with the knowledge it gives us of Tleilaxu society, the story of Waff, the \u2018Master of Masters\u2019, wasn\u2019t particularly compelling to me, and I also found myself wanting to skip through the Sheeana chapters with the petulant girl-child and its cadre of Rakian priests of the Divided God in all their dullard glory. By the end of the book, though, all of the strands do come together, with each playing into the others to produce a truly unexpected conclusion\u2026which of course leaves many questions to be answered in the next, and final, volume. Join me, won\u2019t you?"}, {"label": "neutral", "text": "In some ways, Heretics of Dune marks a significant departure from the previous installments in the Dune series. The plot is no longer focused on the Atreides family, but instead on the Bene Gesserit and its struggle for survival. Yet at the same time, it is a clear return to the original storytelling style of the first book. Rather than the pages and pages of philosophy present in God Emperor, Herbert has written a much more action-driven novel that further explores political powers and characters in the Duniverse.\n\nPerhaps this is why at first, the reader may find themselves quickly tearing through the novel. I personally was eager to read more in depth about the Bene Gesserit, Bene Tleilaxu, and other inhabitants of Herbert's world, and interested to see what had become of Dune 1500 years after the reign of Leto II. Herbert's talent for imagining and creating a fascinating vision of the future of humankind cannot be questioned. On Dune, now known as Rakis, we are also introduced to Sheeana, an intriguing character who can command the sandworms, and thus soon commands the attention of the Rakian priests and the Sisterhood.\n\nSheeana's life seems destined to become intertwined with Duncan Idaho's, the ghola once again revived by the Sisterhood for the apparent sole purpose of \"breeding\" with Sheeana. For the majority of the book, we are led to believe that their timelines are connected and important.\n\nBut the book really isn't about them at all, and in fact it's hard to tell exactly who the book supposed to be about. At first, it seems to be the Bene Gesserit institution as a whole, but the focus switches several times throughout, leaving the reader without a clear reason to follow any of the characters. The subplots are all evidently meant to tie in together, but instead become convoluted and confusing. Too much is left unclear to form a coherent plot. For instance, Sheeana's significance is never revealed. Was her only purpose as a character to herd a worm to be captured and transplanted off-planet? A rather anticlimactic ending for a character deemed by all other characters as practically a goddess. The reader is too often left asking, \"Why?\"\n\nAlong with the Duncan-Sheeana connection, the biggest mystery of the novel is the hypersexuality. Everything all the characters (with the exception of Teg) do revolves around sexual relations or plans for sexual relations between others. While this theme has been present throughout all of the series, it has mainly remained in the background, with Herbert simply informing the reader that the Bene Gesserit has a breeding plan. Some may have noticed the increased sexuality in ; in , it is ramped up to an off-putting and distracting level. Herbert, however, seems too timid or uncomfortable with actually writing about sex. The language skirts around anything explicit until one underwhelming and awkward scene near the end of the book. The effect is one that is just weird, which I'm sure is not what Herbert was going for.\n\nIn the end, rather than keeping up the exciting pace found in the beginning, the novel seems to drag on for just a bit too long, as all of the books in the series do. This, in addition to the vague motivations of the plot(s), weakens the book significantly. While I read the first three-fourths of the book in three weeks, I spent the next three slogging through the final fourth. Rather than being eager to begin , I instead felt relieved to finally be done with . Not a feeling a book should leave you with."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "Heretics of Dune begins a new cycle in the Dune Series. Or, more accurately, an evolution -- consequence -- of the cycle identified in Dune. I enjoyed Heretics of Dune far more than God Emperor, although God Emperor was a necessary bridge between Dune, Dune Messiah, and Children of Dune, and Heretics, as well as Heretic's sister novel, Chapterhouse Dune.\n\nSeveral of the characters are fantastic, in particular Miles Teg, who provides a necessary balance (oddly enough, given the typical focus on men in scientific novels) to the otherwise heavy focus on woman characters. Duncan Idaho, for whatever reason, simply doesn't accomplish this task. In any event, the characters save this story, allowing you to reconcile (overlook?) some of the leaps of logic that are necessary in reading the book. Perhaps this reflects a lesson within the book: the need to make choices, and achieve understanding, on the basis of only so much data and background, and a heavy reliance on intuition.\n\nEven so, the end is a tad abrupt, and I wish elements of the end were developed in more detail. Also, the focus on landscape, on environment, seemed less pronounced. Perhaps Herbert simply took it as a given, a strong thread persistent and present in Dune that must continue. But I think the thread should have been explicitly identified, reinforced, brightened.

One should note that - other than perhaps futars late in D5 and D6), no aliens are in the Known Universe so the humans are all descendants of a diaspore from Terra in the distant past. The idea being that the Zen Buddhists and those of the Muslim faith blended together whereas - apparently - the Roman Catholics split into Bene Geserit and then disappeared. I found no mention at all of polytheist beliefs such as Hinduism or Dualism beliefs such as Taoism.\n\n\nSaudukar (males from Salusa Secundus in service of Harkonnens and Shaddam IV of the Corrino family)\nFish Speakers (females from Rakis in serivce of Leto II)\nHonored Matres (females with mix of various Scattering populations with sexual skills honed to an extreme but also the physical prowess of the Bene Geserit but with extreme violence and no regret or pity)\nBene Geserit (females with extreme martial arts skills and body control)\n\nSome of the most exciting writing in Dune is of course the battle scenes and it is interesting how the elite forces switch from all-male to all-female on the advent of Leto II. The Honored Matres are pretty badass (and very scary) and it was awesome how Miles Teg evolved into a godlike fighter before his doom on Dune.\n\n\nDune / Arrakis / Rakis (home to the Freemen, planet of the Sandworms, sole natural source of melange in Known Universe)\nCaladan (home planet to Atreides clan)\nGiedi Prime / Gammu (home to Harkonnens)\nSalusa Secundus (prison planet - previous home to House Corrino)\nHidden Chapterhouse planet (home to Bene Geserit)\nTleilax (home to Tleilaxu)\nIx (home to Ixians)\nJunction(s) (waystations for the Guild Navigators)\n\nI was frustrated that we never visited Is or Tleilax and learned precious little about any planets besides Dune, Giedi Prime/Gammu and Chapterhouse.

I will write a long post here with plenty of quotes summing up all my Dune impressions for those who wish to read them.\n\n\"When she thought of the largely passive non-Bene Desert populace 'out there', Odrade sometime envied them. They were permitted their illusions. What a comfort. You could pretend your life was forever, that tomorrow would be better, that the gods in heaven watched you with care.\" (p. 49)\n\nOdrade is the daughter of Bandar Mentat (and overall badass mofo) Miles Teg who becomes Mother Superior of the Bene Geserit following the events at the end of Heretics of Dune. She has a deadly standoff with the Honored Matres which dominates Chapterhouse (the hidden BG headquarters planet). She is a great character - full of depth and insight such as the quote above. The Bene Geserit thanks to melange and some genetic engineering created a form of immortality which is threatened with extinction by the Matres flooding into the Old Empire from The Scattering (see God Emperor and Heretics) and Odrade's strategy is a fascinating one to see being put together and then executed.\n\n\"The presence of Others Within who subtracted none of her attention from what went on around her had filled her with awe. . Speaker had said. \" (p. 60)\n\nChapterhouse opened a whole new line of inquiry into the fate of Israel with the characters of the Rabbi and Rebecca - the few last remnants of the diaspora now on a galactic scale. Rebecca is pulled into the Bene Geserit in order to save the Others Within that were massacred on Lampadas by the Honored Matres. While this is an interesting interlude, it is a little frustrating that Herbert throws this in in only the last book of the series and dies before developing this idea any further. The primary interest of this interlude was in fact a bit more information on how the Bene Geserit functioned with the Others Within which was helpful in better understanding them.\n\n\" His slight, childlike appearance was formed in a grey skin whose metallic pigments blocked scanning probes. His diminutive shape distracted those who saw him and hid the powers he had accumulated in serial ghola incarnations.\" (p. 84)\n\nThe last Tleilaxu, Scytale, was an interesting character. Tleilaxu having been destroyed by the Honored Matres, Scytale is a prisoner on the no-ship on Chapterhouse. Perhaps Herbert sensed the end coming because the potential he built into this character (especially the whispering which was supposed to serve as a trigger for the ghola of Duncan Idaho) was never exploited in this book. That being said, he is fairly one-dimensional and serves as almost an albeit morbid comic relief.\n\n\"Honored Matre assumptions about control fascinated Lucilla. You controlled your universe; you did not balance with it. You did not train yourself to sense your own subtle responses, you produced muscles (forces, powers) to overcome everything you defined as an obstacle. Were these women blind?\" (p. 100)\n\nLucilla was one of the most enigmatic and powerful characters in the later Dune trilogy I found. Here she is prisoner to the HM and studying them hoping to get a message to Odrade in time for the BG to prepare a defense. It was interesting to compare the BG before Paul/Leto II/The Scattering (all powerful, mystical, and mega fighters who subjugated emotion completely and sex as a precise weapon and the BG who viewed sex only as reproductive function.\n\nThe key issue in Dune is the disruptive impact of LOVE which ignites the first crisis in D1 when Lady Jessica falls in love with Leto I and rather than giving birth to a girl as her Bene Geserit masters would expect her to do, gives birth to Paul who then exhibits characteristics of the Kwisatz Haderach and becomes Maud'dib to the Freemen when he survives the BG test and achieves prescience. Paul\u2019s love for Chani of the Fremen dooms his political mariage to Princess Irulan and it is Chani that bears his two children, the preborn twins Ghamina and Leto II, soon to be God Emperor and to set humanity on the Golden Path. The next crisis occurs because Leto II loves humanity and wants them to survive. The last crisis is when Duncan Idaho and Murbella fall in love and do not fulfill (once again) BG plans. Unfortunately, we never really get to the end to know whether \"love conquers all\" or just fucks everything up.\n\nFantastic and legendary read. Please comment!\n\n[UPDATE] I am looking forward to Denis Villeneuve's Dune in October 2021. The previews I have seen so far seem to be quite coherent with respect to the book. I was a fan of Lynch's Dune and am curious to see what Villeneuve does with this one. Feel free to comment below.\n\n[UPDATE 2] It has been a few months, but personally I felt that Villeneuve\u2019s Dune was respectful both of the spirit of the original books and of Lynch\u2019s cult classic movie.\n\n[UPDATE 3] Villeneuve made one of sci-fi\u2019s greatest sophomore movies with Dune 2.

I\u2019ve amended some of my earlier critical language as I now LOVE! all of the series an YES! I will read them on a train, and in a plane, and with a fox and in a box, I LOVE Dune Sam I Am!\n\nChapterhouse: Dune was the last Dune novel that Frank Herbert completed and published before his death in 1986. Though he had written notes and the series would continue with his son Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, most Dune fans regard the six Frank Herbert publications as the \u201cOriginal Series\u201d. After many books written since his death, pundits have stated that the only notes left is a post it note that says, \"write more books.\"\n\nIn this installment the direction taken in Heretics of Dune, the fifth book in the series, published in 1984, continues with the Bene Gesserit front and center. Heretics had followed a thousand five hundred year hiatus following the events in the fourth novel, God Emperor of Dune(published in 1981) and had taken a new direction, resurrecting much of the intensity and charisma of the original. The reign of the God Emperor, Leto II, son of Paul Muab \u2018Dib Atreides, has ended and the story has been taken up with political and economic intrigue between the Bene Gesserit and the Bene Tleilax and a new power, the Honored Matres. Chapterhouse involves action between the Bene Gesserit and the rising power of the Honored Matres.\n\nSome of the writing in Chapterhouse: Dune demonstrates Herbert\u2019s best writing. \u201cPower attracts those who are corruptible\u201d muses Herbert and his Dune work represents an accomplished skill that highlights his remarkable powers of observation, detail and complex characterization. \u201cTruth is an empty cup\u201d is another line that I enjoyed and which provoked much thought.\n\nIf I was asked for a recommendation, I cannot endorse the original 1965 publication higher, it is in a rare atmosphere, populated by such classics as Fahrenheit 451, Childhood's End and 1984. If you loved Dune, by all means read the original series and even the other books by Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson.\n\nSo \u2026 what to read now?\n\nA discussion of what to read next by personalities of Lyn\u2019s READER MIND.\n\nFrank Herbert purist: That\u2019s it, stick with what Frank wrote, go back and reread the original Dune. Then read the original six over and over again until you die.\n\nAll things Dune fan: I agree with rereading over and over, always keep a Dune book on your currently reading stack, but you need to reread Hunters now, that cliffhanger at the end of Chapterhouse needs to be sorted out!\n\nGoodreads Reviewer: Over and over? Guys, we\u2019ve got a lot of other books to read besides Dune and we\u2019re trying to read books from more diverse writers and genres. Right? Isn\u2019t that our goal?\n\nLawyer: We\u2019re really busy at work right now, we need easy to read, simple stuff. Stick with the graphic novels and comic strips, Herbert is great but too heavy and too provocative, we need easy reading in our very sparse leisure reading time.\n\nAll things Dune fan: You\u2019ve still got some other Herbert-Anderson books to read, Frank\u2019s vision has been expanded and you want to read them all!\n\nFrank Herbert purist: Abomination! Frank wrote six Dune books. Period. That\u2019s the Dune universe.\n\nSelf Help reader: You also need to reread Covey\u2019s Seven Habits \u2013\n\nEveryone else: SHUT UP!!!\n\nGoodreads reviewer: OK, let\u2019s get back to our international reading and then we\u2019ll come back to which Dune book to take on next.

OK, let\u2019s follow him.\n\nFrank Herbert purist: Abomination!"}, {"label": "positive", "text": "Re-read 8/5/21:\n\nJust to be very clear here: Frank Herbert's originals are absolute classics of SF. It's not just Dune -- although that one is superior to the rest -- but all six of these books that should be put on a pedestal.\n\nThat being said, the density of ideas, the wonderful interlocked wisdom wafting from the pages, the stunning panorama of future history make an absolutely thrilling ride. This one has a lot less action than, say, Heretics, but the reveals and the implications are enough to utterly transform our understanding of the entire Dune universe that came before.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I'm caught between a rock and a hard place. Frank was taken from us too soon. All the various ideas and directions did not finalize in this book. We have a very open-ended conclusion that annoys me as much now as when I was 14-years-old. We need the amazing combination of the BG and the HM, the exodus, and the eventual blow-out that would have come with the inclusion of the thinking machines that drove the HM to near-extinction.\n\nThat's why we needed those two extra books by FH's son and KJA.\nAnd what we got was nothing near what we needed.\n\nIt doesn't change the brilliance of this book or the ones before. It just makes me wish that someone like Brandon Sanderson had swooped in to finish this series in the same way that he brilliantly finished the WoT series.\n\n*sigh*\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nAs with much of Frank Herbert's other writing, excluded, this one is a novel notable and worthy on the realm of ideas. He never stints on ideas. He might get slightly sluggish and lose the thread of the plot while we plod around in the ideas, but there are always great scenes and always great blow-out reveals. The original classic of Dune has none of these faults. It is a classic and imminently readable from page one and is still my favorite book of all time.\n\nSo what about this one? Is it worth reading for everyone else? It's book 6 in the very impressive and automatically Epic series that encapsulates over five thousand years from the events of Dune, ending with the centric viewpoint of the Bene Gesserit after the tyranny of Paul's son and the great diaspora that scattered all the peoples of the galaxy after his death.\n\nThe planet Dune is effectively destroyed at the end of Heretics of Dune and only a single sandworm and some sandtrout were lifted from the planet to be the seed of a new place where the Spice can be produced. This is especially important after the Bene Tleilaxu were also destroyed or partially submerged under the auspices of the Gesserit after the Honored Matres rampaged through the known universe.\n\nThis book takes up the new clones of Teg and Duncan, but mostly revolves around the conflicts between the Bene Gesserit and the Honored Matres. Each side has taken prisoners and tries to subvert the captives. The Bene Gesserit are more than slightly more successful at the task than the \"knock-off Bene Gesserit\" Honored Matres, despite the others being wildly more dominant and deadly in combat.\n\nWhat we have is a novel that reminds me a great deal of the later Wheel of Time books with Egwaine in the White Tower, only, I have to point out that Chapterhouse Dune came out first. :) We know that Jordan was a big fan of Dune and stole a tone of great ideas from Herbert, so this shouldn't be too surprising, but rather than a 5-6 enormous spread of books, Herbert accomplishes a success-from-below story in a single novel. :)\n\nThe teaching and the subversion is the real main story in Chapterhouse. Don't let the cool space battles and space-opera fool you. This is a story of fantastic women doing fantastic things, the undisputed masters of the galaxy, and a massive conflict between the returning diaspora offshoot of the Bene Gesserit and the mainline that stayed behind.\n\nOn that level, it's still a great tale despite my other issues with it.\n\nAnything this complex and full of great observations about human nature, politics, and even love should not be discounted lightly. It's super dense with fantastic ideas on every page and even though it will never be considered a standalone classic, it's a very, very worthy novel to read. Especially in conjunction with .\n\nAnd, I assume, and carry on the tradition well since I'm going to plow through them and continue the storyline set up here. :) The cliffhanger at the end of Chapterhouse was a doozy. :)\n\nLet's see if Herbert's son and Anderson make the ideas into something more traditional, eh? I can hope. They've had a lot of practice in the universe before attempting the big one. Herbert's death put a stop to the story and most of us fans were extremely upset. Hell, I remember reading this book the first time in '89 and wishing I could have written the sequel to it.

After having read those eighty percent, I was more or less ready to give this book a one-star rating.\n\nEven so, I'm raising the whole book to three stars based solely on the short part in the end. Frank Herbert has once again demonstrated his ability to write a boring book where nothing happens and then turn everything on its head in the end. In an impressively fascinating way, I might add.

In small things and big. How many ways there were to prepare delectable, life-sustaining foods, recipes that really were embodiments of loves old and new. This bouillabaisse so smoothly restorative on her tongue; its origins were planted deeply in love: the wife at home using that part of the day\u2019s catch her husband could not sell.\nThe very essence of the Bene Gesserit was concealed in loves. Why else minister to those unspoken needs humanity always carried? Why else work for the perfectibility of humankind?\n\nThis is the end of my Great Dune Reread, which I began just before Denis Villeneuve\u2019s Part One adaptation came out. I last read the entire sequence as a teenager. It is interesting how my perceptions, and appreciation, of the six books have changed over time.\n\n, which I disliked initially due to that (in)famous cliffhanger ending, now emerges as my favourite of the series. Indeed, the second trilogy is, in my opinion, the best of the bunch.\n\nWhat is also clear is how uniquely different each Dune book is, and yet how they all form part of a greater whole. Here we pretty much pick up where left off, but is a far more contemplative novel \u2013 and all the richer for it.\n\nOur main viewpoint character is Mother Superior Odrade, whose favourite pastime is to walk through the orchards of her beloved home planet. Here she notices the telltale signs of the inexorable changes gathering momentum as the last wild sand trout begin the transformation of Chapterhouse into another Arrakis \u2013 the second Dune.\n\nOdrade enjoys her favourite meals, spars with her closest aides, and engages in much ruminative reflection on the nature and mission of the Bene Gesserit, the meaning and consequences of Leto II\u2019s Golden Path, and how everything is now up in the air thanks to the determined onslaught of the Honored Matres.\n\nAnd that is pretty much it for plot. Odrade does eventually hatch a plan to save the Sisterhood, culminating in a rousing final battle between the two great rivals that Herbert paces expertly. (We will ignore the final chapter.)\n\nHerbert\u2019s dubious sexual politics are still firmly on display here \u2013 awakening the ghola Teg Miles\u2019s memories of his previous life involves a scene that is pretty much male rape of a minor. Plus, there is some kind of racial profiling going on with Scytale and the Bene Tleilax that I can\u2019t really figure out.\n\nAnd we have representation of the Jewish faith in the form of the Rabbi and Rebecca, a wild Reverend Mother. If you think that is odd at this distant point in the future, just recall the Orange Catholic Bible from . And it does go to show how the Bene Gesserit respects other cultures and seeks to preserve them, as much as it enjoys meddling in their affairs. All for the betterment of the species, of course.\n\nHerbert\u2019s discourse on government and politics continues to develop and is far more nuanced here. Even his dictum that \u2018absolute power corrupts absolutely\u2019 now morphs into \u2018power attracts the corruptible\u2019. So is the Bene Gesserit a benevolent, yet ultimately autocratic, bureaucratic institution?\n\nIt is a debate that vexes the Mother Superior greatly, who at the same time has to contend with the cold hard fact that the Honored Matres are hellbent on exterminating the Sisterhood. Does this show up the innate weakness and softness of the Bene Gesserit? Or is it an opportunity for them to embrace change, just as Chapterhouse is being changed by the sand trout?\n\nIf you have reached this point in the series, you are long used to the general weirdness and eccentricity of the Duniverse, which combines the baroque and the gothic in the most fantastic ways possible. What makes Odrade such an appealing character is that she is fully rounded and present in the moment, balancing the forces of history against the survival of Chapterhouse and her Sisterhood.\n\nHerbert\u2019s wonderful nature writing lingers long on the blessings of the Bene Gesserit home world and how the desert encroaches upon it. A major theme of the Dune series has always been transformation and evolution, and this really comes full circle in .\n\nAs for that cliffhanger, which Herbert obviously added as an opener for a potential third trilogy, enough clues are scattered throughout the book for the reader to work out who the mysterious Daniel and Marty really are, not to mention the unknown and terrible threat that sent the Honored Matres scurrying back into the Known Universe in the first place.\n\nI have no intention of reading the two \u2018sequels\u2019 that Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson wrote, apparently based on an outline from Herbert\u2019s papers for \u2018Book 7\u2019. Enough reviewers have pointed out how dire these are, but I suppose they do ultimately have a place in the Duniverse (just think how many crap and novels are out there as well.)\n\nMy only wish is that you have seen Villeneuve\u2019s fine Part One and are curious to read the books, or if you have only read itself, that you go on to read all the rest. From the outset it is impossible to predict the strange and wonderful directions that Herbert takes his story. That it culminates in the autumn of a planet and a Sisterhood, as an old woman reflects on her life and the choices, sacrifices, and mistakes that the Bene Gesserit have made along the way, is an incredible parting gift to Dune readers."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "Chapterhouse: Dune (Dune #6), Frank Herbert\n\nThe situation is desperate for the Bene Gesserit as they find themselves the targets of the Honored Matres, whose conquest of the Old Empire is almost complete. The Matres are seeking to assimilate the technology and developed methods of the Bene Gesserit and exterminate the Sisterhood itself. Now in command of the Bene Gesserit, Mother Superior Darwi Odrade continues to develop her drastic, secret plan to overcome the Honored Matres.\n\nThe Bene Gesserit are also terraforming the planet Chapterhouse to accommodate the all-important sandworms, whose native planet Dune had been destroyed by the Matres. Sheeana, in charge of the project, expects sandworms to appear soon. The Honored Matres have also destroyed the entire Bene Tleilax civilization, with Tleilaxu Master Scytale the only one of his kind left alive. In Bene Gesserit captivity, Scytale possesses the Tleilaxu secret of ghola production, which he has reluctantly traded for the Sisterhood's protection. The first ghola produced is that of their recently deceased military genius, Miles Teg. The Bene Gesserit have two other prisoners on Chapterhouse: the latest Duncan Idaho ghola, and former Honored Matre Murbella, whom they have accepted as a novice despite their suspicion that she intends to escape back to the Honored Matres.\n\n\u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u0631\u0648\u0632 \u0628\u06cc\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u0686\u0647\u0627\u0631\u0645 \u0645\u0627\u0647 \u0645\u0627\u0631\u0633 \u0633\u0627\u0644 2019 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc\n\n\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u062f\u0641\u062a\u0631\u062e\u0627\u0646\u0647: \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0634\u0634\u0645 \u062a\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0633\u0647\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646\u06a9 \u0647\u0631\u0628\u0631\u062a\u061b\n\n\u0627\u0648\u0636\u0627\u0639 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u00ab\u0628\u0646\u0647 \u06af\u0633\u0631\u06cc\u062a\u00bb \u0646\u0627\u0627\u0645\u06cc\u062f \u06a9\u0646\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u060c \u0632\u06cc\u0631\u0627 \u0622\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u062e\u0648\u062f \u0631\u0627 \u0627\u0647\u062f\u0627\u0641 \u0645\u0627\u062a\u0631\u0633 \u0645\u062d\u062a\u0631\u0645 \u0645\u06cc\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f\u060c \u06a9\u0647 \u0641\u062a\u062d \u0627\u0645\u067e\u0631\u0627\u062a\u0648\u0631\u06cc \u0642\u062f\u06cc\u0645 \u062a\u0642\u0631\u06cc\u0628\u0627\u064b \u06a9\u0627\u0645\u0644 \u0627\u0633\u062a. \u0645\u0627\u062a\u0631\u0633 \u0628\u0647 \u062f\u0646\u0628\u0627\u0644 \u062c\u0630\u0628 \u0641\u0646\u0627\u0648\u0631\u06cc \u0648 \u0631\u0648\u0634\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062a\u0648\u0633\u0639\u0647 \u06cc\u0627\u0641\u062a\u0647 \u00ab\u0628\u0646\u0647 \u06af\u0633\u0631\u06cc\u062a\u00bb \u0648 \u0646\u0627\u0628\u0648\u062f \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u062f \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a. \u062f\u0631 \u062d\u0627\u0644 \u062d\u0627\u0636\u0631 \u0628\u0647 \u0641\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0647\u06cc \u00ab\u0628\u0646\u0647 \u06af\u0633\u0631\u06cc\u062a\u060c \u0645\u0627\u062f\u0631 \u0628\u0631\u062a\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0648\u06cc \u0627\u0648\u062f\u0631\u0627\u062f \u0628\u0647 \u062a\u062f\u0648\u06cc\u0646 \u0628\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0648 \u0645\u062e\u0641\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u062e\u0648\u062f \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u063a\u0644\u0628\u0647 \u0628\u0631 \u0627\u0641\u062a\u062e\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0645\u0627\u062a\u0631\u0633 \u0627\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u062f\u0647\u062f. ...\u061b \u0627. \u0634\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc"}, {"label": "neutral", "text": "Pewnie oceni\u0142bym t\u0119 ksi\u0105\u017ck\u0119 wy\u017cej, gdybym zobaczy\u0142, jak Frank Herbert domyka cykl.

Yep, it's gone. Well, not GONE, but it is dead, the surface uninhabitable thanks to the honored Matres and the tech they brought with them.\nSheeana, Duncan and Teg's daughter Odrade (now Mother Superior to the Bene Gesserit) have managed to flee with a sandworm and a handful of sandtrouts. So the plan, now, is to turn the planet Chapterhouse into a desert where they'll breed more sandworms so the spice will flow once more and there will never be such a threat to prescience and space travel ever again.\n\nThis plan is somewhat complicated by the fact that the Honoured Matres are zipping through what has remained of the Empire, eliminating any and all Bene Gesserit planets, killing the nobles as well as the Ixians. Oh, by the way, there is only ONE Tleilaxu left, Scytale (saved from Arrakis when the others fled), their technology and knowledge therefore all but gone, too. So everyone is hiding, basically, while trying to bring together everything they have for one last attack.\n\nMeanwhile, on Chapterhouse, a ghola of Miles Teg is bred and raised (weirdly, he's calling his own biological daughter \"mother\") and while I was glad to have him back, I'm not sure I'm a big fan of everyone just being brought back from the dead willy-nilly (fresh blood, in my opinion, would be better).\nSheeana, for the most part, is overseeing the afore-mentioned project to create more sandtrouts and more sandworms but she doesn't really agree with Odrade's overall approach which leads to her and Duncan forming plans of their own.\n\nI must say that after the big bang at the end of the last book, I was somewhat disappointed at the lack of equal action for about the first 3/4 of this final volume. Sure, the conversations, meetings and planning were important but it also felt anti-climactic. I wanted the last remaining forces to strike back immediately and teach those invaders what is what. *lol*\n\nWhat was a nice surprise was the introduction and/or explanation of certain tech, both encountered before and new. It was also a dead-giveaway. *shudders*\nMoreover, we finally got further details about the motivations of certain characters (much needed since we didn't get many answers in the previous book).\nAnd apart from the lessons about trauma we had to witness time and time again, it begged the question of what threat was coming towards the Empire.\nI had a theory (and had it confirmed by Brad for whom this is the umpteenth re-read) and must say that it is THE proof of the author's mastery. He didn\u2019t just keep going to make money, he had a plan from the beginning or this wouldn't have worked, we had all the hints strewn across all volumes (it's what I picked up on here and there) and now, the demons come home to roost! We did get a glimpse at the very end of the book with world-shattering implications but no confirmation / actual confrontation yet (it's maddening).\n\nThe question throughout the book was: are the Bene Gesserit depraved and evil (though at least not as badly as the Honoured Matres) so Sheeana and Duncan were correct\nor are they the only possible bastion against whatever is coming (especially now that\n)?\nThis on top of the ever-present question of: Is this all still the Golden Path?\n\nI'm still not 100% sold on what is coming (yes, I know it after I asked due to the implications in this \"final\" volume). I mean,\n- seems a bit too simplistic. Yes, throughout all books we were following genetic engineering, perfecting humans, but shouldn't we aim for the perfection of our species instead of\n?! What will that lead to? Will\n?! Oh, but how much I would have loved to see the final conflict as written by Frank Herbert! Alas.\n\nLOTS to think about while reading and after concluding the series. I don't think I'll read the books that haven't been written by Frank Herbert himself. I know Brian Herbert and his co-writer followed original notes and cornerstones at least with the next 2 books, but it still doesn't feel right. And despite there being a cliffhanger here, I'll just fill in the gaps myself.\n\nLast but not least, let me thank my buddy-reader, , for this epic quest through time and space.

Mother Superior Darwi Odrade's excitement over the birth of her father, the legendary Miles Teg or rather- a Teg ghola. With Dar's top advisers by her side: the withdrawn Tam and the violent Bell, the novel doesn't waste any time in setting the scene or showing us the principal characters within the Bene Gesserit. After being suppressed by the Divine Emperor/Tyrant, the Bene Gesserit are ready to take on more responsibility and become the key players in Dune's universe again. The Reverend Mothers and Mother Superior are first to 'take the stage' and this is no accident. The sisterhood is in grave danger, threatened to extinction by blood-thirsty Honored Matres. Upon returning from the Scattering, possibly fleeing from something, the Honored Matres have been casually conducting genocide and war in the Old Empire, sometimes destroying billions without much thought. Can one of the unusual Mother Superiors, the romantic Dar, be a match for such a thread?\n\nBesides the above mentioned characters (Teg, Dar, Tam and Bell), there are other important characters finding themselves on Chapterhouse: Dune, such as the youngest ever Mother Superior Sheena and an unusual couple: an imprisoned Honored Matre Murbella, now in training to become a Mother Superior and a Duncan Idaho ghola hiding many talents (that sisterhood is suspicious of). There is also the last Tleilaxu Master Scytale, apparently the only one of his kind left alive after the Honored Matres destroyed his native planet and all of the know Tleixahu civilization. He is now imprisoned by the Bene Gesserit and forced to give up his secrets slowly.\n\nLike in some other Herbert's novels, the planet itself is almost a character. The sisterhood is terraforming the planet Chapterhouse to Dune because they need sandworms (as always the spice must flow). With Dune being destroyed, Chapterhouse must become a new home to sandworms. Sheeana leads this project because of her unique connection with the worms, but she also presents a thread to her sisterhood because of her religious potential.\n\nThere are many other interesting and powerful characters that emerge as the story evolves. For example, when the sisterhood's Lampadas planet is destroyed by the Honored Matres, we are introduced to a fascinating character of Reverend Mother Lucilla, carrying with herself the minds of millions of Reverend Mothers. Lucilla seeks refuge with the Jews on planet Gamu. The introduction of Jews in Chapterhouse: Dune is an interesting concept as is their connection with the sisterhood. There seems to be mutual respect between the two. Lucilla meets a wild Reverend mother among the Jews- Rebecca. This is another female character that has fascinated me. Is Rebecca Bene Gesserit or not? To what extent does her memory influence Rebecca? Many fascinating questions there, not all of them answered, but that doesn't matter. I feel like this is a novel that calls us to be active readers and ask questions ourselves, not just to observe events. In words of Darwi Odrade:\n\n\nWhen I reread Chapterhouse: Dune in January, I realized how little I actually cared about the plot of the novel. Not that the plot isn't good, the 'action' that takes place is well orchestrated but I principally cared about the characters, their monologues and dialogues- and the topics they discussed. Indeed, I didn't even recall some small details despite the fact that Chapterhouse: Dune is a novel I reread many times, more than any other book in the Dune series. What impresses me the most about this book are the philosophical parts of it, often discussed in monologues and dialogues. The careful examination of power and politics, in particular, is one of the strengths of this novel. As Honored Matres and Bene Gesserit try to learn more one about another, there is much talk of democracy, power and governments. The Spider Queen leading the Honored Matres is another strong female character and it is hard not to be fascinated by her, despite her obvious cruelty. As Bene Gesserit sisters try to communicate one with another, with themselves or with outsiders, there is much talk of power. Sometimes they repeat and echo lessons learned in the previous Dune novels, but often they get more specific and speak of governments and traps of power in more detail. How fascinating are those moments when power and laws are so discussed. Not many writers are capable of such subtle analysis, of creating a detailed future society we can teach us so much about our own society and its flaws:\n\n\n\nFor most part, Chapterhouse: Dune revolves around female characters. Two societies of women are at war. However, there are two important men in this novel: Duncan Idaho and Miles Teg. The Mentat specialization is also examined in more detail than I remember encountering in any novel. There is much talk of Mentats in this one. I was always fascinated by them so it was interesting to learn more about them. I sometimes wonder whether this whole novel is not a Mentat projection- and you can recognize it is true by the questions it delivers.\n\nMoreover, love is another important topic in this one. What is love? What is duty? Where one ends and the other begins? The cold sisterhood distrusts love, but can it be avoided all together? They must realize that love is one of the things that makes us human. The sisterhood has a cold view of parenting, often taking away the children from their parents. However, look at the love of Teg's mother for him that survives in his ghola, the love of Dar's substitute parents at the sea planet- it's that kind of love that gives Dar her personal sense of sanity. Similarly, the sisterhood distrusts romantic love. However, they tolerate Murbella and Duncan Idaho's love- as long as it serves them. Can such romantic love ever last? There is love in this book, despite the odds. The sisterhood has a strange relationship with love, but there is love within it, even if the sisters deny it. T Perhaps the most important lessons that this novel has to teach us is hidden in this quote: \u201cRevenge is for children and the emotionally retarded.\u201d That's definitely a line that often makes me think as I can sometimes be quite revengeful in a passive sort of way. Revenge (passive or not) is definitely something to be avoided if you possess any maturity. To conclude, I took my time rereading this novel and found much to admire in it. Highly recommended!\n\nP.S. The dedication that Herbert wrote to his late wife at the end of the novel is one of the most touching things I have ever read.

You will have to refer to the appendix for definitions and clarifications.

This is a very conflicting novel because of the wide spectrum of emotions I felt reading the final chapter.  I was in the last 10\u201320 pages of this novel, thinking damn, there is no more Dune after these pages, this is it. You\u2019re probably wondering what I felt upon the ending. Well,  I am certain the consensus online was that this was a very cliffhanger ending. I am not very adamant about that stance because the ending itself is very clear in what it seeks out to achieve. It's honestly such a beautiful end upon this 6-book saga, even if this was an unintentional ending to the Dune Saga. But to me, it's a fitting one. Reading the final chapter and then reading the eulogy of Frank Herbert Wife straight afterwards was just beautiful and honestly hit you with the strings. There is a lot of controversy in the final two novels of the Dune Saga. It's honestly not for baseless reasons, it's understandable because of Herbert's focus. He writes about these antagonists, who are somewhat the antithesis of Bene Gesserit, the ideas of the Honored Matres are honestly fantastic on paper. The execution is much to be desired. It\u2019s very confusing why the antagonists come across as caricatures because Dune has some of the best antagonists in fiction. You can easily list them in your hands some of them are so iconic. They have a character called Spider Queen, she is not scary at all or intimidating, but she does feature in some of the best back forth minds games in the series.  \n \n\nThe biggest strength of Dune 5\u20136 is, weirdly, the epigrams. These were just esqusites\u2014the amount of lore, knowledge, characterisation thinking upon this Saga as a whole. I mean, this is world-building at its finest. It's such a minor thing in the novel, but the amount of depth it provides, unveiling Bene Gesserit sisterhood and so much more\u2014I mean, that is beautiful. Speaking of the sisterhood, god, I love exploring Bene Gesserit, from the big activities to the small activities in the Chapterhouse. The area is just somewhat disturbing it feels artificial, it doesn\u2019t feel right, and Herbert conveys it so well, like a perfect area but sometimes too polished, it\u2019s not authentic enough. I won\u2019t talk about that aspect, but I have to admit that I really like Orade. If you do not like Orade, then this novel won\u2019t click. She is the main character for most of the novel. Her nuances are fascinating to explore, as are her vulnerabilities. Bene Gesserit at the height of their power, seeing the cracks in her armour and her flaws, is something I enjoy reading. I will honestly defend Herbert's characterisation a lot of times, he uses indirect characterisation I think with Orade, it does show in her relationship with\n . It's such an interesting concept, and I wish Herbert showed it more. He always does this, like when an idea is literally tangling right in front of him, it wouldn\u2019t take too much effort as the pieces of are right there, but he won\u2019t do it.  So the positives so far are Bene Gesserit lore/worldbuilding, Orade, great mind games,\n, the ending and atmosphere.\n\nI\u2019ve already discussed my dislike of the Honored Matres and them feeling like papercut antagonists. The other criticism I do agree with is that Herbert's writing is at its weakest in the Dune Saga. The dude who was dying was writing this novel, and medically, he wasn\u2019t very fit. He passed away a year later, after this was published. Unfortunately, it does show in the actual writing. I generally like Herbert's prose a lot, and here it\u2019s still the same (me enjoying it), but it's a step down in quality. A friend of mine binge-read all 6 novels and for him, it felt like a different author. I read pretty spread apart. I cannot deny or agree with the claim, but it's worth pointing out. It\u2019s very unpolished in that aspect, though I argue the epigrams, eulogy and other writings are some of Herbert's best. Now the pacing isn\u2019t great. This might be the most poorly paced Dune book in the series. I do not know how to articulate the pacing, but it\u2019s a weakness of this novel. Even as a person who didn\u2019t have as much of an issue with pacing, I can visibly see it being the worst. What makes this more evident to me is that the novel lacks those massive moments. What I mean is every Dune novel you can point out, this is a HUGE moment. When thinking about the past books, there are a lot of big highlights, even Heretics have those big moments. Chapterhouse doesn\u2019t have that, or, should I state, very few standout moments. When they appear, it's great, but it's not that much. Murbella is an okay character, I understood the intention, but I ain\u2019t sure if Herbert executed her that well\n. But I did enjoy a lot of her chapters weirdly, though I was rarely invested in her (or as much as I hoped). Sheeana, I like her, especially her last chapter by herself, which was brilliant. The oddity of the novel is the weirdly handled sexual aspects. I am not against this in fiction, I feel like people are honestly too sensitive to the sexual aspects of fiction. But Herbert does not write it well enough to say it kindly.\n\nIn Conclusion, I really liked this novel a lot, way more than I suspected, and I would say this Dune Saga has been such an experience for me. I'm not sure how to rate this or if there's a point rating it. All I can say is thank you, Frank Herbert, for these 6 novels, some of my favourite novels of all time and which have impacted me so deeply that it\u2019s kind of insane. This isn\u2019t a normal series I can read, have fun with, and go on to the next. It\u2019s something that just ponders in my mind consistently. There are a lot of life lessons, cautionary tales, and so forth. Now that it's time to say goodbye, I don\u2019t regret this journey. Though one last thing, I will say I never met Herbert, but I feel like I would love to have a drink with the man hearing about his philosophy in life and perspectives on given situations.

Many have complained that it doesn't \"go anywhere\" for the first 150 pages or so, but I think it does. There are all of these seemingly unrelated plot threads that slowly but surely converge such that by the time you're halfway through the book, it all makes sense. The last half of this book is a mixture of intrigue and action that left me breathless and unable to put the book down until I was finished. The story here continues from the end of Heretics of Dune, with the Bene Gesserit hidden on their base planet of Chapterhouse, hiding and regrouping from the rampaging Honored Matres who hunt and slaughter them across the galaxy. However, the Bene Gesserit soon deduce that the Honored Matres themselves are being hunted, driven back into the Known Galaxy from the outer depths of The Scattering...and who these mysterious hunters are is not known. A desperate plan is conceived and ultimately carried out, but nothing goes as it was 100% planned and the resulting outcome leaves the two orders in shambles, merged together by force, with factions resisting, including some of the major players, who make their escape into the unknown. Throughout all of this are glimpses of two mysterious and all-powerful watchers who try to gather the most powerful of the renegades in their net...what ends up happening? Read it to find out!\n\nChapterhouse: Dune is famous for it's ending, which has been alternately called \"cliffhanger\" and \"open.\" There has been raging debate over the intervening 25 years whether or not Frank Herbert intended to complete the saga with a 7th book, or leave it open-ended and finished with Chapterhouse:Dune. This is bolstered by two arguments...the short tribute to his wife that follows the final chapter (she died a year before this was published) and the fact that the mysterious watchers take the form of an elderly couple patterned after Frank and his wife Beverly. Further muddying the waters are the two horrendous \"sequels\" Herbert's son and his hack-writing partner Kevin Anderson published, supposedly based on an outline for \"Dune 7,\" the supposed sequel and wrap-up to the saga, written by Frank Herbert and found in a safe-deposit box after he died in 1986. I won't get into any spoilers here, but suffice to say that the fact that the VAST MAJORITY of the \"sequels\" tie in characters created and introduced in Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson's \"prequels,\" written YEARS after Frank died, and it's clear that, even though the outline may very well exist, they did not follow it one bit. This becomes clearer after reading the \"sequels,\" (and don't worry, I'll savage those books and reveal the lies from those two after I read them again and review them on here).\n\nThus, we are left with an open/cliffhanger ending that is at the same time satisfying and frustrating. This is a testament to Herbert's imagination and talent, however...the final chapter of Chapterhouse:Dune is chilling and amusing and leads your imagination into a million \"what-ifs\" about what happened next.

That said, I did like it and it is certainly not a bad book, but it does suffer in comparison to the previous installments.\n\nNow I have to decide if I am going to sample any of the subsequent novels by Brian Herbert and Kevin J.

Honestly, I\u2019d recommend stopping at God Emperor, the threads are tied up nicely and I\u2019ve no problem saying the first four books form a single masterpiece. And then you get the last two and they\u2019re kind of weird and janky and unfocused. Herbert is clearly an incredibly intelligent writer, and you never get the sense that this is really substandard writing. In fact, there are some fine moments of political theory and the usual bon mots, but they\u2019re infrequent at this point; it seems dragged out, very little really happens.\n\nHeretics of Dune I think is a stronger book for sure. If you\u2019re really curious about the Bene Gesserit, they become the focus of the last two books. The books focus on political systems, how corruption and the road to fascism being inevitable. And it focuses on Duncan and Sheeana, potential messianic figures who struggle between the self and their society. As the new governments take over, the systems grow more and more corrupted and empty as they become figureheads of ego. And to a degree this, the final Frank Herbert Dune book, is satisfying in that it seems to conclude the journey of these characters (among others) in a way which feels thematically appropriate. But I just thought it was boring. Not a lot happens, so your really just listening to conversations that are not as interesting as they were in previous books. I don\u2019t know what happened or why the quality would dip like this at the end. I could also completely see why this could be a 4 star book for some as it\u2019s definitely still Herbert, but I expected some big resolution that capped the series to this point and this is more like a meandering to-be-continued space opera.\n\nI\u2019m glad that I stuck it out, but it\u2019s a little odd given the quality of the earlier books that the author didn\u2019t really get to stick the landing. And look, the last two books are sexist. It\u2019s clear that it\u2019s the far-future and this is a fantasy, but the extent of the Honored Matres is ridiculous. I get that this is coming out of the seventies, it\u2019s talking about women\u2019s society and the sexual revolution and I can take it with a grain of salt. It\u2019s intellectually interesting but overdone. The actual way the Bene Gesserit and Matres led government functions wasn\u2019t as clear to me either as it was with Leto. It just didn\u2019t seem as thought out beyond, what would a corrupt, godlike government of women look like?

Herbert's universe only grew richer as it grew away from the Atreides, and in my opinion, more interesting. Paul, Leto II, Alia, etc were all interesting characters, but they are much more interesting when they are not actively shaping the stories of the universe, instead being looked upon as lessons, or warnings. The Tlelaxu, the Bene Gesseret, the Honored Matres, all are so much more interesting to me. I wish that we had seen the finale that Herbert had in mind, but I would consider this, even so, to be a satisfying conclusion.\n\nInterestingly enough, I had always been told that the only Dune books worth reading were the first 3, that after that it got \"too weird\" but I had the opposite experience.

This review contains no spoilers.]\n\nDuring the first half of his literary career, Frank Herbert focused most on coming to terms with what it meant to be conscious. The evolution of his thinking on the subject can be traced from real-world events which happened to him in his youth, through his earliest published science fiction stories, crude as they were, and on into novels like and the stories that would coalesce into , and certainly and . This line of thinking reached its fruition in the novels and .\n\nHaving expanded his understanding of the full spectrum of consciousness about as far as it could go (although admittedly he never stopped tinkering with the subject), in the second half of his career Herbert refocused his attention on how the limitations imposed upon individual consciousness \u2013 or perhaps it might be better to say the limited perspective encompassing a single human lifetime \u2013 leaves humanity ill-equipped to confront an infinite and ever-changing universe. In effect we end up in a continuous crisis mode, always vainly insisting that the world of tomorrow conform to the expectations of yesterday. We're persistently and comically always shocked to discover our assumptions are wrong. Elsewhere I have described this aspect of Herbert's thinking, the human failure to deal with, or even to recognize, the implications of an unbounded universe, as an . This theme begins to emerge in and is especially prominent in , for a final surmounting of the absolute-infinity breach is the primary target of Leto II's Golden Path. But we also encounter the concern in Herbert's final trilogy: , , and (by implication) in the unwritten .\n\nIt is a hallmark of Herbert's imagination that he pursues an ever-elaborating expanse of concerns, always tracing a spectral pathway across a continuum of broadening bandwidth, chasing after considerations of widening implications across grander and grander scales of magnitude. An original interest in a fleeting moment of hyperconsciousness ultimately led Herbert into defining consciousness, hyperconsciousness and subconsciousness in all their aspects and dramatizing what he had learned and concluded in his stories; likewise his contemplations of the diverse implications of the absolute-infinity breach. And it might be added that he pushed his spectral analytical approach through time as well, so the saga becomes probably the most temporally discontinuous series ever written. The first three novels take place roughly around the year 21,200 AD. The drama of unfolds 3,500 years later, and that of the last three books ( and are difficult novels, and attempting to distinguish them as separate novels, or independent from the unwritten , is an artificial and arbitrary exercise) takes place an additional 1,500 years after that, placing us circa 26,200 AD.\n\nAs the primary goal of and was to shatter the innate mythmaking in humanity that compels us to conservative convergence, these last three books are intended to unveil the consequences of living in a multiverse that has become irreparably divergent. This divergence followed in the wake of the downfall of the God Emperor and the subsequent Scattering of humanity not throughout multiple star systems or galaxies, but across multiple universes which are discontinuous with one another. Any threat can now come upon our heroes and heroines from any direction, but with all the eggs no longer in one basket, no matter what catastrophe might befall locally, the whole story can never come to a final end.\n\nIn (1984) and (1985), the Bene Gesserit has recovered substantially from the tribulation of the era of the God Emperor, and now we're allowed a far more intensive view of the inner workings of the Sisterhood than ever before. But the Bene Gesserit and the remnants of the old Imperium, as ever, are confronted by a host of power-hungry enemies, new and old, in the usual style of Herbert's Machiavellian plotting. It is these plots-within-plots that seemingly all other reviewers have focused on, and I'll forego doing the same here.\n\nHerbert said it wasn't until he was writing that he came to understand that an important role of an author was to entertain his readership. That will come as surprising news to some of you who like Herbert, and not to some of you who don't. But it's important to note that the word \"entertainment\" carries different connotations for readers than it does for hacks or more seriously-aspiring authors. Entertainment is something that is doled out to the action-adventure-thriller crowd, to those who love reading or going to the movies in no small part for the sheer escapism of the thing. Now I'm not overly bigoted about this. There's nothing more boring than a book that's, well, boring. But I think what Herbert was getting at was that as he matured as a writer he came to see, as many writers do, that plot is less interesting than character, no matter how many car chases or lasgun exchanges are involved.\n\nI for one can't separate a reading of the last books of the series from knowledge of what was going on in Herbert's life as he wrote them, which he did, by that way, at an absolutely furious pace. This happened to be during the most stressful part of his entire life. His wife, Beverly, had been dying for ten years, and the last two years of her life were especially painful for her and for her husband, both physically and emotionally. I believe that, had he lived, Frank Herbert would have easily written the novel to complete the series. I am less sanguine that he could ever have written another coherent novel after that one.\n\nBy the time was published in 1981, and with the signed contracts for the later novels in hand, Herbert was financially secure but, as I've suggested, he was suffering from increasing emotional instability. Furthermore, I can't help believing he was struck by a supreme irony, which is that, like Paul Maud'Dib, he now found himself hemmed in by the conservative mythology of his own image which he himself had created. To this day you can still see this in reviews of his later books, wherein readers who were born after Herbert's death still bemoan the fact that his later books are not like in style. Everyone wanted, and continues to want, Frank Herbert to write books that seem like quote-unquote Frank Herbert books: everyone wanted, and wants, Herbert to remain frozen unchanging in 1965. But in his later years Herbert, with his financial security, felt free to try to break out of that myth regardless of the demands and expectations of his fans, and for this I applaud him. I'm sure he did have basic plot elements in mind for the last three books of the series \u2013 call this the \"entertainment\" necessary to bring the masses along \u2013 but it's quite obvious that he had already grown more interested in character development than in weaving such masterful webs of palace intrigue anymore.\n\nHerbert wanted to change course, but he had not yet found a new direction. I see hints of this in , in which Duncan Idaho tells Alia about the practice of setting out blocks of marble in the desert to be etched by the blowing sand of a Coriolis storm. Idaho argues that the sculpted pieces produced are beautiful but they are not art, as they are not carved according to human volition. But in the latter books it is Sheeana who creates an abstract sculpture she calls \"The Void,\" which is art. How might these two kinds of sculpture compare? What is the symbolic significance of Sheeana's abstract work? The question is particularly relevant, it seems to me, when Sheeana's piece is recognized as a symbol set in tension with a Van Gogh which, at the end of is carted off into a new, uncharted universe. Clearly, I think, the matter can be read as a form of self-psychoanalysis undertaken by the author. \"The Void\" is the primitive and unformed new expression welling up inside him; the old and familiar, even conventional Van Gogh has been let slip away with a fond farewell.\n\nA kind of quantum uncertainty pervades and which are, after all, a single story occupying multiple volumes. We do not have enough pieces to interpret this story or to fairly critique its parts, which must therefore remain finally unadjudicated and unjudgeable. This is because the unwritten was also to have comprised a full third of the complete tale. We can see that Herbert was bending writing to a new direction, and we can hazard some educated guesses about (entertaining) plot elements that would have informed the third book, but we can never know. The best we can do is ponder any written records or notes that Herbert may have left behind as poles in the sand to mark the path he intended to follow. Anyone who possesses any such notes, it seems to me, can be a good steward to the memory of Frank Herbert only by publishing them in unexpurgated form: lacking that, Herbert's career accomplishments can never be properly assessed. And that is an injustice to an important 20th century American writer."}, {"label": "negative", "text": "10,700 word analysis of my reread\n\nPeople change. 10 years ago I read the Dune series for the first time, and it became my favorite series ever. In 2019 I started my reread of the series, and now I\u2019ve finally come to the end of that project, finishing Chapterhouse: Dune, the 6th book. 10 years ago, I thought Chapterhouse was the pinnacle of the series \u2013 today, I think it is its nadir, and I would not call the series as a whole a favorite anymore.\n\nIn what follows, I will first try to explain why I think Chapterhouse: Dune is the weakest of the bunch. The bulk of this post will be an analysis of the book\u2019s main themes, and their relation to the previous books.\n\nFor starters an examination of the Bene Gesserit. The main question I still had after reading Heretics was about their intentions, and I\u2019ll check how Odrade\u2019s emotions play out in Chapterhouse as well. I\u2019ll also look into the question of free will again \u2013 the main issue of the first Dune. I\u2019ve written shorter sections on change & creativity \u2013 change being the series overall constant, on Nietzschean morality \u2013 yet another recurring theme, on the obscure & conflicted nature of Mentats and, finally, on Herbert\u2019s obsession with bureaucracy, something that popped up in Heretics already.\n\nBefore I wrote my actual analysis, I lined up 85 quotes with a total of 5500 words. Not all of those made the cut, but the text is quote heavy nonetheless. If you don\u2019t want to read quotes, just skip them: in most cases, you should be able to follow my reasonings without them.\n\nI\u2019ll end with a short assessment of the series in general.\n\n(...)"}, {"label": "negative", "text": "Finally, finally, I've come to the end of this weird, meandering, navel-gazing series. For me, the series ended satisfactorily at God Emperor. I'd even had various people (most of them teachers, no less) advise me not to read past a certain book in the series, but, like, you can't tell me not to read a book, man--I'm gonna read the book you just told me not to read. After all, I reasoned to myself, I'd come this far, and there were only two more, and I didn't want to leave the world of Dune feeling as if it were unfinished. Surely, two whole books must have something of value in them. Right?\n\nHeretics and Chapterhouse are parts one and two of a larger fifth book in the series, one that delves into the inner-workings of the Bene Gesserit, which makes it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is. Instead I got two books worth of bureaucrats dancing around with a society of militarized dominatrices.\n\nThat also makes it sound more interesting that it actually is.\n\nOne thing I do appreciate about Heretics and Chapterhouse is the inclusion of more female characters and characters of color in main or important roles. While the first few books had a decidedly Lawrence of Arabia in space sort of vibe--i.e., white men traipsing around the desert playing war--Heretics and Chapterhouse feel more diverse and grounded, as if the world were more real, more textured, not just a sandbox for bored white men.\n\nIn hindsight, I think I could have stopped at God Emperor and not missed much, but I don't regret sticking with one of the most avant garde series in the science fiction genre."}, {"label": "negative", "text": "Absolutely interminable.

This book tells us more than any other what the B.G. really does, what their true roles are, what their fate is. I like Dar as a main character, and I enjoyed seeing different aspects of Murbella, especially. The revelation of a secret religion surviving through millenia was a great addition to the Dune world. I loved seeing a different perspective than the Zensunni belief system and then the worship of the God King.

It's hard to explain the difference because it's something I feel from my own experience, so maybe some would find this book just as deep and complex as the others. For me, the main appeals are concluding the series, seeing the arc completed (or, is it??), as stated above, getting more in depth with the Bene Gesserit, and, finally, finding answers about the Honored Matres. As a separate book, it's interesting because it's so mysterious and for the philosophical, political, and sociological perspectives, but its real value comes in concluding the story of Dune/Arrakis/Rakis. I do have to wonder, though, if Herbert had been able to write more novels before he passed away, would they become more like Star Wars? The Old Empire, the Million Planets, is just a core cluster of galaxies, but after the Scattering, we have infinite possibilities, potential, and variety.

It's definitely worth reading the last few pages."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "\u201cSurely you know bureaucracies always become voracious aristocracies after they attain commanding power.\u201d\n\nAs foretold, I have completed my reading of Frank Herbert\u2019s original six Dune books.\n\nSpoiler alert: Frank the tank went to meet Shai hulud in the afterlife right after finishing this book so it doesn\u2019t really have a complete ending to the story. It may have been for the best because he probably would have wound up churning out sequels like the fast and the furious and tanked his reputation instead of letting his kid do it.\n\nSo the last two books are weird and all over the place. There is a ton of strange sex stuff in including one thing I found disturbing to the point of questioning why he would include it. But basically the bene gesserit have been harried near to their ending by the \u201cwhores\u201d the honored matres who have returned from the scattering to deep space. Herbert\u2019s writing got better and better over the series but it also got more dense and convoluted.\n\nIt seems like the whole thing is an argument against centralized, bureaucratic government because it holds back the interests of humanity in favour of its own power. It seeks to condition free thinking and individualism out of people from early childhood on so they may be ruled more easily.\nI heard Herbert was into psychedelic drugs and was probably a big hippie so it makes sense and it\u2019s a valid point.\nSo anyway, I liked all the books in the series but you have to be in the mood for it. Part one and four are my favourites."}, {"label": "neutral", "text": "3.5? \ud83e\udd7a"}, {"label": "neutral", "text": "Frank Herbert's last Dune novel suffers from the same flaws as Heretics of Dune. One that I didn't mention in my review of that novel, but which certainly applies to both, is the lack of a character to care about. In the first four Dune books, Leto, Paul, and Leto II provide central figures whose rises and falls the reader becomes invested in.\n\nNone of the characters in Heretics or Chapterhouse stand out in that same way. The fact that almost every character is a Bene Gesserit, trained by a Bene Gesserit, or belongs to a similar order only exacerbates the problem, as does the fact that dead characters keep returning as gholas. Maybe another part of the problem is that I was never impressed with or interested in Duncan Idaho, the only character who appears in all six Dune novels."}, {"label": "negative", "text": "the anti-semitism went nicely with the terrible writing and idiotic plot"}, {"label": "positive", "text": ""}, {"label": "neutral", "text": "More than likely three and a half stars, but I don't round up unless I think it warrants the upgrade. Three-fourths of this book was quite enjoyable, but the final one-fourth was tedious and messy. Too much action in too many places to keep track of, especially when significant time passed from one to the next. I get the feeling Herbert expected to continue/finish this saga in future books because this ended with plenty of important and unanswered questions. Luckily Brian Herbert doesn't have access to an axlotl tank, else he'd probably make a FrankHerbert ghola and force him to write more books. As unseemly as that may be it is most assuredly better than the shitefest of \"Dune\" books assembled by Herbert fils and that other guy. Anyway. I loved the battle of wills and wiles between the Bene Gesserit and the Honored Matres in this book. Nothing like two groups of colossally badass females working things out for control of the universe!! As in previous books, Herbert gives you plenty of major ideas to consider. Thinly veiled - and obviously bald-faced - attacks and debates on religion, democracy, authority, bureaucracy, passivity, power, sexual mores, education, social structures... Yes, this is just as meaty and wide-ranging as one has come to expect. I will say things got rather bogged down towards the latter part of the book, a bit heavy on the behind-the-scenes scheming and backstabbing and plotting. Still, the worms are back, and how can that be bad?!? Melange!!! So all the superlatives of the first 5 'Dune' books, but a few negatives. Sadly, I leave the Dune-iverse disappointed since I will never know what Frank Herbert planned to do with his creation.

On the one hand I am sad it\u2019s over with no definitive conclusion, on the other I am pleased to have found that the series not only held up, but actually appeared to be better than I remembered. I have to admit that I came I to this volume assuming I might only give it a 2 or 2.5 star rating, perhaps 3 stars at most, based on my recollections that the later Dune books continued to decline in quality until you came to the nadir with this final volume of Herbert\u2019s original work. I\u2019ll still admit that I can see how most (or maybe even all) of the volumes after Dune itself are perhaps an acquired taste, but I have to say that I have found myself impressed with the series as a whole on this re-read and have definitely come away with a much greater appreciation for the overarching story of the Dune universe that Herbert was trying to tell.\n\nWe come as the Sisterhood of the Bene Gesserit are beset on all sides by the seemingly overwhelming power of the Honored Matres, newly arrived refugees from the Scattering. Proving to be almost unbeatable in their combat skills and overwhelming in numbers, the Honored Matres are overtaking Bene Gesserit planets one by one, enslaving their populations or obliterating their worlds when necessary. Even Arrakis, the infamous Dune itself, is now nothing but a glassed wasteland destroyed by the vengeful Honored Matres. Unable to attack, the Sisterhood waits, plans, and hopes on their central world of Chapterhouse with nothing to protect them other than the shielding of their genetic heritage - built into them by Leto II, the Tyrant - and the no-ship technology which together allow them to avoid mechanical and prescient prying eyes. It is an open question, however, just how long they will be able to remain hidden. Luckily, they have some special resources in addition to their vaunted powers and link to generational Other Memory, key among which are the mentat-ghola of Duncan Idaho, his captured Honored Matre lover Murbella, and the woman Sheeana whose attunement to the worms of now destroyed Arrakis made her such a desirable addition to their ranks. They have also adopted the nefarious axlotl \u2018tank\u2019 technology under the guidance of the captured Tleilaxu Master Scytale and have decanted their own creation: a child ghola-clone of the redoubtable Bashar Miles Teg. Will it be enough to save them?\n\nThe prospective reader will be pleased to know that they do get at least a partial answer to this question in this volume, so they are not left completely hanging, but there are still a number of significant story threads that I would have loved to have seen Herbert tie up. No doubt this is part of the difficulty of judging the Dune series as a whole (especially if you choose to ignore the latter efforts of Herbert-fils and his ghost writer friend) and may have contributed to the general ambiguity (if not outright dislike) often heaped upon Herbert-pere\u2019s later volumes. It can perhaps be difficult to judge the subsequent volumes of the Dune series without being unduly influenced by the giant shadow cast by the first book, but I think it\u2019s an exercise worth trying. Dune itself is certainly a genre making, or shaking, book and its shadow is long indeed, but despite this fact, for me it is no longer \u2018Dune and all the books that kept getting progressively weirder that followed it\u2019 in my mind; now it is \u2018the stories of the Dune universe that evolved as Herbert worked on and developed his ideas.\u2019 There is still plenty of weirdness here, no doubt of that, but it\u2019s a weirdness that I now find much less jarring and I enjoy the subsequent volumes not only in and of themselves, but as a part of the greater story of the Dune universe which I find a fascinating place. I think Frank Herbert was a victim of his own success with the first volume and I would have loved to have seen how he would have developed this ongoing universe in his own way, but alas that was not to be."}, {"label": "negative", "text": "Having reached the end of this long and arduous series, my dominant thought is 'finally.'\n\nChapterhouse: Dune is similar enough to Heretics of Dune that it seems as if it could be one book split in two. Chapterhouse takes place only a few years after Heretics, and like Hereitcs, it involves average writing, a mildly interesting plot, and typically static characters. More of Herbert\u2019s trademark dawdling narrative. Easy enough to swallow in the beginning of the series when the fantasy world was exciting, new, and fresh, but by the sixth book, requires pulling out your wading boots and slogging through.\n\nJust about the only aspect of the series that continued to pique my interest in this final installment are the maxims that touch on governance, bureaucracy, and politics. While much of what Herbert has to say is contained within the storyline and the characters themselves, I've found that the maxims in combination with the action are his more clear and powerful modes of thematic expression. This is a strength that has not altered since the beginning of the series, in addition to, of course, the description of fantastic planets in his imaginary universe. From the orchards to the sea, Herbert made the planet of sound more pleasant than most, peaceful and lush with vegetation.\n\nHerbert also garners a renewed interest in the individuals of his story. Among the typical fixed characters, used as representations of the themes of religion, politics, and power, are two relatively shining beacons of character development: Odrade and Murbella. In Odrade we find the deepest look into a Bene Gesserit yet, including flashbacks of her childhood. It provides a refreshing contrast to the sterility commonly seen in other members of the order. Truly getting to know a character gives the reader someone to root for, something that was missing from . Odrade forms a much stronger lead presence, and for what felt like the first time, a main character has emotions. The reader can somewhat feel her worry of the Honored Matres, her sadness at changing Chapterhouse to a desert. If Herbert had been a stronger writer, this could have been exceptionally powerful.\n\nIn a similar way, Murbella serves as a breather between stiff and hard-to-follow dialogue among other characters. Her spirit brings something new to the Sisterhood, and ends up revolutionizing the entire order. Additionally, the fondness Murbella and Duncan have fostered for each other is a nice balance to the overdose of sexuality in the previous book. Murbella is, plain and simple, likeable.\n\nStill, as Herbert's characters are embodiments of his themes, I have always wished they would be fleshed out a bit more. In combination with a slow plot, it renders it difficult to tell which is the main focus of the book, the story or the characters. As the series goes on, neither end up being particularly strong, and that is especially true of , a book which could have easily chopped out 200 pages and remained coherent. While having fewer loose ends than , this may be because it simply has fewer plotlines to connect. Still, elements are introduced that never find a resolution, such as the Futars. While it's possible these mysteries would have been solved in the next planned installment, it remains rather unsatisfying.\n\nAlso, there's pedophilia, so that's uncomfortable and weird.\n\nThough possible to squeeze some enjoyment out of this novel, especially in the beginning, it remains a book to read for only those completionists determined to finish the series. And no, I certainly do not plan on attempting the books created from Herbert's notes by his famously less-talented son."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "After tens of thousands of years, the theme of ultimate prophetic prediction, spice (i.e. water/oil) dependence, universal religious programming, not to mention a great primer on behind-the-scenes political activities, comes to a close. and what a perfect way to bring this series to an end. Well worth the devotion, this series follows one genetic line with supra-sensory perceptions which gave birth to a messianic figure and his son, whom became a galactic tyrant in the name of progress, nay, of love. i could gloss over the insane amounts of information and wealth of ideas/ research Mr. Herbert put into this story-line, but would rather you deduce for yourself.
