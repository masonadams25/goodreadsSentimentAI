In my head, the purpose of this review is very clear. It is to convince YOU to read this book. Yes, you! Waste time no more. Go grab a copy.

Machiavellian intrigue, mythology, religion, politics, imperialism, environmentalism, the nature of power. All this set in a mind-boggling, frighteningly original world which Herbert ominously terms as an "effort at prediction". Dune had me hooked!



The very first stirring I felt upon opening the yellowed pages of Dune was that of stumbling upon an English translation of an ancient manuscript of undeniable power and potence which had an epic story to narrate. The tone was umistakably sombre and I realized Herbert was not here to merely entertain me, he was here to make me part of the legend of . It was intriguing and challenging and heck, since I live for challenges I decided to take this one up too, gladly. The challenge was the complexity and depth of the plot, which left me perplexed, in the beginning. I knew there were dialogues which meant much more than their superficial meaning and was unable to grasp at it. I felt a yawning chasm between Herbert's vision and my limited understanding of it. However, of course, I plodded on and could feel the gap closing in with every page much to my joy and relief.



"To the people whose labours go beyond ideas into the realm of 'real materials'- to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this is dedicated in humility and admiration."

The foreword makes it pretty clear that Frank Herbert isn't kidding around. This is a serious effort at predicting how our world is going to look two thousand years from now and by God, it's a bloody good and detailed prediction. However, the real merit in this effort lies in the commentary on our lives in the present.



The setting of the book is arid futuristic. the plot is driven by political mind games reminiscent of The Game of Thrones. The issues he tackles are as modern as the colour television. Herbert's genius manifests itself in his ability to combine the past, the present and the future in one sweeping elegant move called Dune.



Dune is set in a futuristic technologically advanced world which after the (the bloody war between Man and Machines) has eliminated all computers and passed a decree declaring . Since there are no computers, the essential working of the galaxy is still and with heavy reliance on men and their dallying around. Lots of thriller potential right there. Men with superhuman analytical abilities called have taken the place of Computers. On the other hand, we have the , an ancient school of mental and physical training for female students (it gives them superhuman intuitive powers) who follow a selective breeding program which makes them feared and mistrusted through the Imperium. Their desired end product of this breeding program is the , a superman who‚Äôll be able to glimpse into the future. How he‚Äôll be able to do this is rooted in Herbert‚Äôs idea of determinism: given that one can observe everything and analyze everything, one can effectively glimpse the future in probabilistic terms. Quantum physics anyone? The is the proposed solution to the male-female dichotomy, between the analytical and intuitive.

The plot of Dune is almost wholly set on the desert planet of (also referred to as Dune), an arid wasteland where water is so scarce that men have to wear stillsuits which recycle human moisture for further consumption. The source of the galaxy‚Äôs interest in the planet is , a spice which bestows upon one longevity and prescient powers. Everything on the planet is permeated with the spice, the air, the sand, the food. Everybody on the planet is hopelessly addicted to the spice, their only hope for survival being their continued intake of the spice. The , the economic and trading monopolistic arm of the Galaxy badly needs the spice for interstellar transport. This is because their frigates travel faster than the speed of light and hence travel backward in time. The spice is the only way they can look into the future and see their way ahead. How cool is that! All the powers on the Galaxy are out to mine the spice, braving the sandworms, their name merely an euphemism, for they are gigantic 200 metre long creatures which always come digging through the sand whenever spice mining is undertook. . There‚Äôs also another little glitch. There exist on the planet, the kickass native desert tribal , whom the foreign powers look down with suspicion and disdain. The ethos is one of survival and scarcity, driven by tribalism and egalitarianism. Okay, I‚Äôll stop right there. No more spoilers about this. Except that they value water to the extent that spitting on a person is the highest honour they can bestow upon him.

Our protagonists are the family, consisting of the Duke, his Bene Gesserit concubine Jessica and their son Paul, who have been entrusted the stewardship of Arrakis. We discover the alien planet of Arrakis along with them, firstly with fear, suspicion and wonder and ultimately, love and respect. , however is no ordinary prince. There‚Äôs a teeny weeny chance he might be the , something which troubles him constantly and gives us our conflicted hero. The poor chap over the spice and has visions of black hordes pillaging and murdering around town bearing his flag and sees his dead body multiple times.

My favourite character, however has to be the , the most evil character I‚Äôve ever come across in my literary excursions. He is ruddy ruthlessness, he is virile villainy, he is truculent treachery. He executes the inept chess players in his employ which says oodles about his badassery and his fondness for cold-blooded logic. He sees everything in simplistic terms. What is my best move? What is my opponent‚Äôs best move? Is there anything I can do to completely squash his move? Is there a tactic which leads to mate in three?



In this setting, Herbert does so much, it‚Äôs unbelievable. Religion, politics, the dynamic nature of power, the effects of colonialism, our blatant destruction of our environment are themes which run parallel to the intensely exciting and labyrinthine plot. He shows the paramount importance of myth making and religion for power to sustain over long periods of time.



Now these are my thoughts about what Herbert could have meant to be Arrakis-



It makes perfect sense. Herbert draws heavy inspiration for the religious ideology of Muad‚ÄôDib from Islam. He says ‚ÄúWhen religion and politics ride in the same cart and that cart is driven by a living Holy man, nothing can stand in the path of such a people.‚Äù which is the philosphy of the politics of Islam. Islamism in a nutshell.

The spice, much desired by everyone, is the oil. Baron Vladmir Harkonnen is symblomatic of the wily Russians. The Desert foxes Fremen are representative of the native Saudi desert-dwelling Bedouin tribe who have a strongly tribe-oriented culture and undoubtedly value water in equal measure. And the ultimate loser is the environment.



I almost forget this is a science fiction novel, it‚Äôs that real. It is also scary and prophetic. It is a reading experience that will leave you dreaming of the grave emptiness of Arrakis and make you wish you were there to brave it all in the privileged company of the noble Fremen. Frank Herbert achieves the pinnacle of what a sci-fi author aspires to rise to; authentic world building.

I was so worried that I wouldn't understand a thing in this book. I will admit there are some things that went over my head but for the most part I figured it out.

I remember a billion and 65 years ago I watched the movie and was like what the? Basically all I remember is Sting and sandworms. I would love to watch it again and see if I understand it more after reading the book.

I'm still not sure what all the spices were about on Arrakis. I keep thinking it's like their farming like we would farm corn or tobacco, etc. I could be wrong and I didn't get the connection between the spice and the sandworms. Is it like a drug to them? I did read in the back of the book that is was like a drug when taken in small quantities and really addictive when taken in large quantities and that Muad'Did felt his prophesies were because of the spice.

I liked Duke Leto and I hated that he was betrayed not long after they got to Arrakis. There is always some twat out there causing trouble.

I really enjoyed Paul's character and his mother Jessica. They seemed like really strong people and adapted very well in everything they were put through. I didn't really pay too much attention to the other characters or I guess I should say I didn't have many thoughts about them. With the exception of the ones that betrayed them.

I really enjoyed when Paul and Jessica had to travel to get away from the evil Baron Harkonnen before they were killed too. I don't know why, but I enjoyed their little journey. I think they were both great in their roles when they were found by the Freman and showed they were a force to be reckoned with. Now maybe I'm getting this all wrong but I'm trying to tell it through the way I saw it in my mind.

I don't understand how Paul's sister, Alia, was an abomination. That one must have went over my head too. It might have had something to do with the poison Jessica took to become the Reverend Mother. I'm not sure but I know some of my goodreads friends that read this will get me sorted out =)

Other than the sandworms and traitorous people on Arrakis, I was most freaked out by the thought of the water issue! I would NOT was to live somewhere there was a water shortage. And the part where they were talking about selling foot water, I can't even. Which basically means your stinky foot sweat!

Anyhoo, I really loved the book!

Let me start by first apologizing to everyone who loves this classic. I don't doubt Dune was something special when it first came out in the 1960s. But reading it for the first time today, it feels horribly outdated to me and at times almost incomprehensible.

I was warned going into this story that the beginning is extremely hard to understand, but that is an understatement. I could barely follow its scene after scene of dialogue referencing people and places and events, all with no explanation or context. It literally feels like I was just dropped into the middle of a book, and everything had already been explained elsewhere.

But it gets better, right? Well, only somewhat. A narrative does take shape, but the writing style remains confusing and obscure. It manages to be both long-winded and not clear enough, if you can believe that. Certain obvious points are harped on again and again, but other crucial ones are merely glossed over. Then, when you inevitably miss those important points, they create this cascading effect that keeps you mired in confusion.

The writing is also pretentious, with regular or nonsensical things consistently being presented in a profound way. There are plenty of extraneous paragraphs that sound good until you try to discern their meaning, at which point you'd be stumped. This sort of writing really confused me because I couldn't figure out which paragraphs mattered and needed to be dissected carefully to suss out their hidden meaning, and which ones are just adornment.

As for the story itself, it was a complete mismatch with my interests. I like science fiction with lots of real science. Instead, this is a space opera (a.k.a. a soap opera that takes place in space) with no actual science. It's all political intrigue, melodrama, doublespeak, and who has power over who, which I have zero interest in. I also couldn't care less about how fawningly amazing Paul is and how he is destined to be the chosen one.

This was such a frustrating reading experience because it could've been an amazing story. And there were moments in the beginning when I thought it was going in those creative directions. I was riveted during that infamous test in the first scene, only to realize that it was completely irrelevant to the rest of the story. Or to see where the book could take the scientific aspects of a desert planet and a population with so little water, which it didn't other than a bit of lip service.

But the book stubbornly chose to disregard these more interesting avenues, and instead took the most straightforward, boring route of making this into a story about power struggle. Well, we could've saved ourselves the bother and just stayed on Earth for that.

Dune.

No other single syllable means as much to the science fiction genre, a single word that conjures images of sandworms, spice wars, great battles between rival dynastic families and a massively detailed and intricately crafted universe. No wonder this is widely regarded as not just a Science Fiction masterpiece, but a literary achievement as well.

Like a study of Shakespeare, the reader finds that this is an archetype upon which many influences and imitators have based their works. The complexity and depth of the creation is staggering and I am continually astounded at the discipline with which Herbert must have focused his imagination.

This is the book upon which Herbert would base his greatest series and one that would outlive him as his son has continued to expand and add detail to the vast, immaculate tapestry woven by a true master of the genre. Encapsulating political, economic, sociological, biological, cultural and dynastic themes, Frank Herbert has set a high standard for later practitioners.

Brilliant.

***2015 reread - Read years later, this has lost none of its narrative power, if anything I can better appreciate the virtuoso attention to detail Herbert exhibited in his epic creation. From the perspective of having read his later 5 Dune sequels, I am astounded at the rich tapestry he has woven. Most impressive was his close omnipresence, analyzing the thoughts and minute actions and subtle nuances of his complicated dynamic interplay of characters. The exhaustive training of the Bene Gesserit and the intricate relations of the Houses and the Guild would stand as a monumental benchmark for speculative fiction ever since.

This time around I found myself looking more closely at the Harkonnens and will likely read some of Brian Herbert's additions to his fathers great work.

***2019 reread - I'm even more in love with this book and am again in awe of Herbert's narrative skill. This time around I noticed that all of the quotes that begin chapters are from Princess Irulan and I paid close attention to how Herbert crafted these interludes.

I also was drawn to the religious undertones that really began very early in the book and how Paul realized his gifts and was preparing for his role in the beginning chapters - all demonstrating Herbert's great narrative skill.

Finally, I became more aware of what a great character was Gurney Halleck. While the ghola of Duncan Idaho dominated the later books, Herbert's creation of Halleck was an enjoyable and thought provoking addition to this masterpiece.

There's a characteristically witty essay by Borges about a man who rewrites Don Quixote, many centuries after Cervantes. He publishes a novel with the same title, containing the same words in the same order. But, as Borges shows you, the different cultural context means it's a completely new book! What was once trite and commonplace is now daring and new, and vice versa. It just happens to look like Cervantes's masterpiece.

Similarly, imagine the man who was brave or stupid enough to rewrite in the early 21st century. Like many people who grew up in the 60s and 70s, I read the book in my early teens. What an amazing story! Those kick-ass Fremen! All those cool, weird-sounding names and expressions they use! (They even have a useful glossary in the back). The disgusting, corrupt, slimy Harkonnens - don't you just love to hate them! When former-aristo-turned-desert-guerilla-fighter Paul Muad'Dib rides in on a sandworm at the end to fight the evil Baron and his vicious, cruel nephew, of course you're cheering for him. Who the hell wouldn't be?

So that was the we know and love, but the man who rewrote it now would get a rather different reception. Oh my God! These Fremen, who obviously speak , live on a desert planet which supplies the Universe with melange, a commodity essential to the Galactic economy, and in particular to transport. a very subtle way to say "oil"! They are tough, uncompromising fighters, who are quite happy to use suicide bombing as a tactic. They're led by a charismatic former rich kid (OK, we get who you mean), who inspires them to rise up against the corrupt, degenerate... um, does he mean Westerners? Or only the US? And who Baron Harkonnen intended to be? I'm racking my brains... Dubya doesn't quite seem to fit, but surely he means ? Unless, of course, he's just a generic stereotype who stands for the immoral, sexually obsessed West. This is frightening. What did we do to make Frank al-Herbert hate us so much? You'd have people, not even necessarily right-wingers, appearing on TV to say that the book was dangerous, and should be banned: at the very least, it incites racial hatred, and openly encourages terrorism. But translations would sell brilliantly in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and a bad movie version would soon be made in Turkey.

I honestly don't think Herbert meant any of that; but today, it's almost impossible not to wonder. If anyone reading this review is planning to rewrite , you'd better make sure you get your timing right. Who knows how it will be interpreted five years from now?

No one should argue the importance Dune. It laid the foundations for a great deal of the themes and constructs in modern science fiction. Frank Herbert was as important to the genre as Isaac Asimov and Arthur Clarke. Unfortunately, just like them, he's quite dated, and his books can be a labor to read. One thing he maintained from old science fiction was prim and scientific dialogue that no one would ever actually speak. I've known many scientists, and they don't talk like this. You're not going to convince me a child does.

The stuffy dialogue is inserted into even stuffier narrative, until it feels like nothing is organic about Herbert's prose. This is a terrible tragedy when you've got a world that he put so much effort into building - and it is an amazing feat of world-building, technically interplanetary building. But unlike J.R.R. Tolkien, who he is so frequently compared to, Herbert didn't make sure to include a great story in his world. Instead he included a story that frequently illustrated how clunky an artificial world can be, even if it's lovingly crafted. I struggled to attach or find interest in anyone, yet they're more archetypes than human beings, whose logic races past modern skepticism and whose dialogue is cloyingly artificial, the way people cared for the Hobbits, Dwarves and Rangers. In his world-building, Tolkien at least saved himself from being dated by antedating himself, and even with his illuminated prose, wrought more characteristics in just one protagonist than all of 's cast.

Even the political intrigue Herbert tries to fall back on was overdone in the Spy genre decades before he started this book. All fans of the "Genre" genres should appreciate Herbert's massive contributions, but they shouldn't pretend to enjoy the books if they don't, and they should be wary of certain pitfalls typical of science fiction that survived into his landmark work.

My YouTube Review (admittedly totally Fangirling):
https://youtu.be/JilubCWr9Kk

This was one of the best books that I have ever read which I was not expecting at all. First, the book is incredibly put together and really well thought out. Often, the author wrote the book in such a way as you can hear the character's thoughts which was a really interesting perspective and provided a more immersive experience.

The book touches on so many different deep topics and is so inspiring, moving. The book was also so unpredictable and unique. Highly recommend.

Nope. Sorry I don't get it.

I was able to finish it by listening to the audiobook but I was bored throughout the whole 21h.

So many descriptions... anyone else found the way Paul's mom describing him kinda weird?

And let's not even mention how many times I laughed at the main female character being called Jessica.

I'm sure I'll get plenty of comments telling me ... At the end of the day, my rating is always based on my enjoyment.

While the cultural impact of this book is indisputable, I couldn't help feeling incredibly underwhelmed when reading it. Even the plot couldn't save Dune, since it's spoiled at every juncture by 'Princess Irulan' and her epigraphs before each chapter. Did no-one tell her about spoiler alerts?

From the very first pages, this book plunges you in at the deep-end with an absurd amount of overly complex world-building, which just makes the book laborious to work through. It wasn't for me, and the post-Dune reading slump is real.

Update 6/27/23

Re-read, number 15.

This time, I read it with my daughter. Sure, it might be a bit too soon for her, but she DID insist because we'll be seeing Dune part 2 later this year. And she happens to know that I'm a rabid uberfan with no mercy or remorse.

PLUS, I was able to read from my gorgeous new hardcover copy gifted to me by my best friend and that really does make all the difference, no?


Update 9/15/21

Re-read. Number 14.

I cannot get over how beautiful this book is. Still my favorite after all these years. It only gets better with every re-read.


Update 8/28/17

Re-read. Number 13. :) I cry when Paul meets Gurney. I shiver when Jessica consoles Chani. I'm awestruck by the peaks and troughs of time, free-will, and the weakness in Paul even as he heroically strives against the evil that is about to be unleashed upon the universe.

*sigh*

Perfection. Easily the number one book I've ever read. :)

I waver, sometimes, but right now, it is my absolute favorite. :)



Original Review:

This is a phenomenal classic of literature.

It's not just science fiction. It transcends science fiction, as a fascinating discussion of free-will versus inevitability. Can the Jihad be denied? Can Paul ever really avoid his own death, despite seeing every time-line play out with him as the butt of every cosmic joke? Can even cruelty or mercy even remain comprehensible after such knowledge?

Yes, I think this work outdoes Nietzsche. It certainly does a great job of making us care about the question.

Is this all? Is this just a work that pays great justice to philosophy of action and inaction?

Or is the novel merely a clever play at turning the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle into the physical embodiment of a man? It is that, of course. The Kwisatz Haderach can be many places at once, and he can be both alive and dead at the same time just like that certain cat.

Is the novel a coming of age tale, first set as a mirror against his father Leto, only then to mirror the whole universe that had just turned against him? Yes, of course. He was, after all, both the product of all his upbringing and his genes, embodying the question of nature versus nurture. He was taught within many schools of martial arts and assassins, as well as training the mind in both the schools of the Mentats with their pure logic and that of the mystics, the Bene Gesserit, that allows complete control over the body down to the cellular level. And if this training wasn't enough, he was deeply schooled in politics, leadership, and the meaning of loyalty. The boy was raised right. Of course, that is nothing without ninety generations of genetic bloodline tampering from the Bene Gesserit, right? To become the fulcrum between cellular memory, tapping the minds and lives of all your genetic ancestors as well as tapping the ability to fold time and space, to become the eye of a storm of time.

What a damn brilliant setup for one tiny character, no? His training links to the unlocking of his genes and to the life-extending and enveloping spice, Melange, to make him not merely aware of time in a theoretical sense, but eventually to be unable to discern what was in the past, the present, or the future. Here's a true Super-Man, well beyond Nietzsche.

And don't believe for one second that this serious discussion about what would make a superior man makes for dull reading. No. We've got PLOT that's probably some of the most exciting and visceral in all of literature, driving us right into the web of intrigue, vengeance, treachery, and galactic politics.

To quote the text, we've got "Plans within Plans," and it hardly stops there. We know the House Atreides is falling into a trap laid by the Emperor and House Harkonnen, and yet free-will and pride prevents any chance to avoid it. The setup is brilliant and extremely political, giving us character sketches of some of the most brilliant and memorable characters of all time.

Duke Leto, the Red Duke, the most honorable and beloved leader.
Duncan Idaho, the emotional and intuitive hero.
Gurney Halleck, archetypal loyalist and troubadour.
Lady Jessica, the woman who ought to have had all honor in life, but was unjustly reviled and set aside for political necessity. (Chani being both her mirror and her eventual glory.)

And of course, my favorite character of all time, Paul Muad'dib Atreides, the one that would prevent the greater evils he foresaw, and went to enormous lengths and sacrifice to achieve, but who eventually failed in his task because even a god cannot overcome destiny. (Or the will of so many minds set as one.)

So damn brilliant.

Frank Herbert spent five years writing this treasure, working and reworking it until he published it at age 25. None of his other works come close to this masterpiece, and there's little wonder. It was birthed, fully-formed, like Athena from Zeus's head, with enormous forethought and care.

The worldbuilding was just as carefully formed, from the ecology of Arrakis and the life-cycles of the sandworms, to the history and the creation of the Fremen from their mild beginnings as Zensunni Wanderers, adherents to the Orange Catholic Bible, to their history of oppression so like those of those who are Jewish, to their settling and hardening of their bodies and souls in the wastes of Arrakis, also just like the Jewish who carved out a place for themselves in Israel. (Current politics aside, this was a very potent idea before 1965 when Herbert wrote this, and indeed, the core is still just as powerful when you turn it back to Muslims.)

The Galactic culture is rich and detailed. The CHOAM economic consortium, with their monopoly on space travel and their need for the Spice to allow them to see a short period into the future to plot a safe course before folding space. The Empire is caught on a knife's edge between a single power and every other House who sit in the possibility of putting aside all their squabbles for the sole purpose of checking the Emperor, if they so desired. (And Duke Atreides was such a possible popular leader among all the Great Houses, which was the primary reason the Emperor wanted him dead.)

And of course, we have our Villains.

The Baron Harkonnen has always been a crowd pleaser. Brilliant in his own right, devious and able to corrupt anyone with just the right sorts of pressure, including a certain absolutely trustworthy doctor we might mention.

"The Tooth! The Tooth!" -- You can't handle the Tooth!

Feyd Rautha Harkonnen is especially interesting for the question of nature versus nurture.

The Bene Gesserit had intended him to mate with Paul, who should have been Leto and Jessica's daughter, and that offspring should have been the cumulation of ninety years of a breeding experiment to recreate the Kwisatz Haderach which had come about almost by accident during the Butlerian Jihad in the deep past, to overthrow the AI overlords.

He was practically Paul's genetic twin, or at least, his potential to be the "One who can be many places at once" was on par with Paul. But instead of fulfilling the kind of destiny that we get with Paul, we see him grow up under the auspices of his Uncle the Baron, becoming as cruel and devious as he was deadly. He was the argument of nurture in the conversation, of course, and having so very little of it eventually cost him his life.

I often wonder about the directions that Dune could have taken, all those little paths in time and circumstance that could have been. What if Feyd had been brought to Arrakis earlier and overwhelmed with Spice the way that Paul had? Sure, he wouldn't have been able to convert the unconscious changes into conscious manipulation, but he might have had enough glimpses of the future, the way that the Fremen did, to have given him the edge he would have needed to kill Paul.

And then there's a relatively minor character, Hasimir Fenring, the Emperor's personal assassin, who was nearly the Kwisatz Haderach, himself. Unable to breed true, he was still potent enough to be completely hidden to Paul's time-sight in the same way that Paul was hidden from the Spacing Guild's weaker time-sight. His training as a skilled killer was also superior to Paul. He was, by all the hints and tricks in the tale, Paul's perfect downfall. It always gives me shivers to think about, and it was only in a single instant of both recognition and pity from Paul that stayed Fenring from killing our hero. It was just a moment of whim.

The setup was gorgeous. Paul's pity, had it been missing at his moment of greatest triumph over the Emperor, would have meant Paul's assured death. I still wonder, to this day, what stayed Frank Herbert's hand from killing his most wonderful darling. We knew the pressure of religion and politics was going to have its way upon all the oppressed peoples of Dune. The return of a monstrous religious Jihad was going to happen one way or another, sweeping across the galaxy and toppling the Empire, regardless of Paul's frantic plans and desires. Paul's own death would only mean a higher level of fanaticism, and Frank Herbert's warning against unreasoning devotion would have been made even clearer with Paul's death.

Perhaps it was pity that stayed his hand. Who are we to say who lives and who dies?

If you really think this review is overlong, then I apologize, but please understand that I could absolutely go on and on much longer than this. It is a symptom of my devotion to this most brilliant of all tales.

And yes, it still holds up very, very well after twelve reads. I am quite shocked and amazed.

Update 2 March 2024
I saw Dune 2 and the first one is nothing compared with it. Actually, most movies are nothing compared to Dune 2. Maybe Villeneuve is the real Kwisatz Haderach.

Update! Just wanted to say how much I loved the movie. Go see it. It was probably good that there was a gap between the time I read this and the movie.

Read 2015
Amazing! A masterpiece of SF with which I will probably compare all SF books that I‚Äôll read in the future. It goes in my favorites shelf.

This is my 3rd attempt to read Dune and I am really grateful that I did not succeed the first two times I tried as I was too young to understand all the subtleties. I would have probably enjoyed it as a very well written adventure novel but nothing more. That would have been a pity as Dune is so much more than a story about space travel and epic battles between good and evil. It presents complex philosophical ideas, explores ecological issues, cultural identity and differences. Also a major theme is represented by religion and religious leadership.

The disturbing part about this book, taken in the current political context, is how easily the Fremen can be identified with an Arab nation. The spice can be seen as ‚Äúoil‚Äù and the Harkonnens as evil westerners/Russians that are exploiting the natural resources without thinking about the locals and the environment. I saw that others reviewers saw this as well.

‚ÄòDeep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.‚Äô

The sheer scope and magnitude of this 1965 sci-fi drama is staggering, populated with an extensive cast of characters and a rich universe full of well-rounded lore, intricate politics where every actions is revealed as ‚Äòplans within plans within plans,‚Äô and dynamic cultures all set on a collision course of plot that rightfully earned it a wide readership and canonization as a ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù work. I found it lived up to the hype and opened itself up more upon a reread, validating the fond memories I had of it from reading it first as a young teenager smitten with anything sci-fi. This book has zero chill and everything is to extreme and epic levels, including the size of worms. But come for the Bene Gesserits, best part. While there isn‚Äôt much to say that likely hasn‚Äôt already been said better, I still want to pause and reflect on some key elements in . This is such a well-crafted book that addresses themes of power, religion, historical records as mythmaking and environmental concerns in a narrative about proxy wars and power struggles that speak just as loudly today as it did about 1960s foreign policy. If you are looking for a book of epic proportions, you can‚Äôt go wrong with .

The best part about this book, to me, is the way it is constantly expanding. There is great world-building and a rich lore that recalls my glee first exploring , but what really excites me is the way Herbert reveals it all. The book starts so small‚Äîa visit to a cottage from an old woman that seems like such a small scale fairy tale on page one‚Äîand swiftly becomes gargantuan and never stops growing. It leaves you constantly feeling yourself shrink beside a universe always revealing itself as more complex than you had realized. I enjoy the way Herbert only gives you the minimum of what you need to understand and lets it all slowly unfold when necessary.

‚Äò‚Äô

For newcomers, the basis of the book is that Paul has been quite literally bred to be a messiah and is engulfed in a difficult power struggle over a planet that essentially upholds the interplanetary economy through mining an addictive substance called ‚Äúspice‚Äù. You might quickly find yourself thinking of spice as oil and the planet Arrakis as Middle East and Northern Africa (Tor put out a really ), you know, since there was a whole Cold War going on at the time and giving the villain Baron Harkonnen a first name like Vladimir might make you wonder if this is all an elaborate metaphor. The Baron saying ‚Äò‚Äô might make you think of the three branches of US government. You get the idea. There are also WWII holdovers present, such as the Sardaukar as an elite fighting force trained on Salusa Secundus to make sure you catch the S.S. reference. That‚Äôs all very much there, but this book is so much more than a simple sci fi rendition of the Cold War and Herbert definitely wants you to apply these themes to our larger political and religious global interactions.

‚Äò‚Äô

Another aspect I find fascinating in is the depiction of Paul Atreides in the ‚Äòchosen one‚Äô trope. Paul has reservations, though not due to thinking he doesn‚Äôt deserve it (dude is royalty anyways, essentially) but because he fears what it will bring. Paul‚Äôs powers are enhanced through spice and he is able to perceive the future, and in almost every possible scenario he sees nothing but mass war in his name:

The notion of precognition brings free will into question, particularly when a certain individual appears in visions of the future but dies before it happens. It becomes a universe where individual free wills are all acting upon one another in an attempt to control the narrative of time.

History is written by the winners, or so the saying goes, and much of this novel focuses on the way the narrative of time is constructed through the mythologizing of people and events. ‚Äò‚Äô Jessica says to Chani, assuring her that her role as the lover to Paul will not be usurped by the princess he marries for the throne. Much of the book shows the dynamics between Paul as the Man and Paul as the myth, with characters like Stilgar recognizing that by being in service to the myth they too will be immortalized in the stories. Narratives become a form or power, and, as I‚Äôll discuss soon, can be a form of control.

Perhaps it is because power and control are so central to this novel that it feels so very timeless and just as applicable to 2021 as it did to 1965. In regards to power, leadership also becomes another key theme. ‚Äò‚Äô House Atreides Duke Leto says, ‚Äò‚Äô a sentiment later echoed with all the same key terms by Baron Harkonnen. The two leaders are set up at the start as foils to each other, each trying to have their grip on Arrakis (there are some strong colonialism themes in this book and it delves into how troubling it is and how even those we might view as the savior turn out to be just another oppressor and colonizer) but their leaderships are defined by Leto‚Äôs rule through caring for his people while Harkonnen sees everyone as a useful pawn.

Having recently finished , I could have preferred some more voices in this book looking for better forms of ruling that don‚Äôt involve exploitation, but that‚Äôs not what this book is about so I‚Äôll move on. What this book really focuses on is the ways power can be maintained, which crops up most in this novel through use of religion. ‚Äò‚Äô we read, and the harsh life on Arrakis makes it the perfect setting where indoctrination of religion for the purpose of power can shape a community and unite them. Religion is a form of storytelling, having the people all believe in one shared story with all its myths and promises. ‚Äò‚Äô Jessica instructs Paul, ‚Äò‚Äô The stronger the shared faith, the more easily a leader can make them do what they need. It also helps that everyone is high as shit all the time. ‚Äò‚Äô Kynes's father says:

Religion is being used constantly to shape the people for the purpose of their leaders, even in what seems an admirable purpose of turning desert Arrakis into a green paradise (and without a religious idea of paradise, how can a people who only know dry dirt and hardship even imagine a paradise?).

‚Äò‚Äô

This latter bit is also extremely key to Dune. The planet itself is practically a character in the novel, much in the ways the landscape is like a character in Westerns. The landscape of Arrakis truly shapes the people there, and we see a contrast between Arrakis and Caladan and how water as a precious resource on Arrakis changes many customs. Such as how spitting at a person is a sign of respect on Arrakis. Changing the environment on Arrakis is an interesting concept because, in order to make it thrive, what would the cost be? Would it disrupt spice, thereby collapsing the galaxy‚Äôs economy? Can these people ever be free, because doing so would require the complete dismantling of the governmental systems currently ruling? Can I try this spice? I would like to try the spice.

There is also something to be said about the harshness of an environment being an ideal place for strenght in unity around a cause to crop up. Le Guin explores this in as well, with the anarchist planet having a similar dry desert vibe as Arrakis and scarcity being a major player in what keeps the people bonded and working together. The Fremen are tough because of their environment, similiarly the Sardaukar are trained in extremely harsh environments as well. plays a lot with ideas on how fascism and strongmen can quickly rise to power in times of economic instability‚Äîor the threat of it‚Äîand here the difficult planets tend to produce the most deadly fighters. Mix religion in and you have an instant army if you can convince everyone you are the chosen one.

There is so much more to discuss in this book, particularly the Bene Gesserits and the Guild who are pulling a lot of strings, or just how friggen awesome the worms are. This is a big book with a lot of big ideas, and also a lot of ambiguity to them that I really appreciate. It is certainly a precursor for a lot of popular epics to follow. George Lucas certainly took notes and I imagine read this and said ‚Äúwait, you can just beloved characters that easily!?‚Äù before rewriting Duke Leto as Ned Stark. While I can concede to those who find it boring and dry, I rather enjoyed all the history and lore and found this to be incredibly fun.

Ok, my only reference for Dune was the 1984 movie with Kyle MacLachlan. And, honestly, it was the main reason I've always wanted to read this book.




Anyway.
I remember that movie when I was young. I honestly didn't remember much about it other than it was sorta weird, there were giant worms, a bunch of people had glowing blue eyes, and Sting was in it.



After listening to this audiobook, I decided to rewatch the movie and relive the good times.



Wow. Just .
What in the holy hell did I just watch? Because whatever it was, it certainly didn't have much to do with the actual book. There were some changes that they made to the movie that really didn't do anything for the plot. Like that gross dude with the shit in his face that flew around in that goofy air suit?



In the book, he's just a fat dude!
And that thing they do where they all have attached to their hearts?
Not in the book, either!
In fact, none of that fucknut crazy/gross sci-fi shit is in the book.



Blowing shit up with their voice guns? Nope.



Bald Bene Gesserits? Nope.



Bugs with butthole mouths? Nope.



Mentat's with clip-on eyebrows who drink juice that gives them herpes lips? Nope.



Captain Jean-Luc Picard going into battle with a pug? Fuck no!





Not that it should matter.
Because I was expecting something realllyreallyreally different, and if you go into this (like me) you may end up...well, not but maybe shocked?
Having said that, I think the book was definitely better.
There was no reason for ass-mouth monsters or oily rock stars in weird rubber underwear. It just makes a lot more sense the way Herbert wrote it.
It's a tale set in space with an incredibly interesting look at how politics and religion can hold hands with each other and make war babies. I can see why people rave about it. It's honestly an incredibly insightful novel.




A little , but worth it.
That's worth saying twice because this thing is massive and you may get lost in it if giant word monsters aren't your jam when it comes to reading.



I listened to the Audible version which is long and might be the way to go for anyone looking for the easy way out.

People often forget that this series is what innovated our modern concept of science fiction (up until Neuromancer and The Martix, at least). Dune took the Space Opera and asked if it might be more than spandex, dildo-shaped rockets, and scantily-clad green women. Herbert created a vast and complex system of ancient spatial politics and peoples, then set them at one another's throats over land, money, and drugs.

Dune is often said to relate to Sci Fi in the same way that Tolkien relates to Fantasy. I'd say that, as far as paradigm shift, this is widely true. Both entered genres generally filled with the odd, childish, and ridiculous and injected a literary sensibility which affected all subsequent authors.

Few will challenge the importance of Star Wars' effect on film and storytelling in general, but without Dune, there would be no Star Wars. Princess Alia, the desert planet, the Spice, the Bene Gesserit, and Leto II all have direct descendants in the movies. It is unfortunate that Lucas seems to have forgotten in these later years that his best genius was pilfered from Herbert, Campbell, and Kurosawa.

Though I have heard that the later books do not capture the same eclectic energy as the first, Dune itself is simply one of the most original and unusual pieces of Sci Fi ever written. Read it, Starship Troopers, Ringworld, Neuromancer, and Snowcrash and you'll know everything you need to about Sci Fi: that you want more.

2021 Reread - 5*

I was totally blown away by the recent movie version of this, that much so I decided to revisit and revaluate my opinion of this extraordinary book.

So, I read it again six years on and this is something I said I would never do because I found it so difficult to read the first time. It wasn‚Äôt the complexity of the world and politics, but the narration style which totally perplexed and frustrated me. Though I think that was more to do with my immaturity as a reader at the time than anything else. This is a difficult one, but it‚Äôs worth it.

This time I was impressed with everything: the intelligence of the writing, the details of the world and the intricate nature of the storytelling. There‚Äôs just so much brilliance here. And it‚Äôs entertaining. It‚Äôs interesting. The balance is perfect.

The Freman culture is driven by ideas of ecology, efficiency and waste reduction. And whilst they are not without their faults, the sense of oneness and appreciation they have for their home planet is a strikingly important commodity. I found them fascinating to read about and of the many thing this novel has going for it, they are the jewel in Herbert‚Äôs crown.

I want to see more of this world.



I could never give Dune five stars because I really struggled to get into the novel in the beginning. It has taken me almost two months to read. This, for me, is a very long time to spend on a book. It took me so long to read because I found the writing style incredibly frustrating. I had to read whole chapters again so I could get the gist of the plot. This was more so in the beginning, which I found particularly hard to read because of the author‚Äôs way of shifting between the thoughts of multiple characters. I found this very annoying; however, I persevered over my initial despondency towards the writing, and plodded on through the book. I‚Äôm glad I did so because in the end I did come to really enjoy it. Indeed, the story is fantastic, but the writing will always remain unbearable for me.





is to science fiction what is to high fantasy; it is the novel that officially, and unarguably, defines the genre. The story begins with the house of Atreides accepting the Dukedom of the planet Dune. The former Baron has been ousted by the Emperor, and is no longer of consequence. Well, that is how it initially appears. Very early on it revealed that the whole thing is a political ploy to bring the house of Atreides to its knees. The Baron lies in wait, and is ready to strike against the new, and benevolent, approach the Duke uses on the Fremen.

The Fremen are the natives of the dessert planet; thus, they know how to survive its harshness above all others. They do this through their frugal approach to water. They value it above all else, and will never waste a drop in earnest. The Baron Harkonnen, as a chide against the natives, squanders water in the cruellest ways. He, and his dinner guests, throw cups of water on the floor of the dinner hall; it was his tradition. The wasted water was soaked up with towels, which the Baron allowed the Fremen to suck the water out of. When the Duke enters he rejects this custom, and is more respectful to the Fremen way of life. He and his son and heir Paul, who is the protagonist of this novel, go as far as to try the Fremen‚Äôs grossly effective water saving suits. These Stillsuits, quite literally, recycle all the water the body wastes and feeds it back to its wearer.





This early familiarity, with the Fremen technology, no doubt helps to keep Paul‚Äôs mind open when he is later forced to live amongst the Fremen. Paul is somewhat of a marvel; he is prophecy‚Äôs chosen one. When he eventually gains the trust of the Fremen they allow him to choose a Fermen name. He calls himself after their most revered prophet: Muad'Dib. They accept this and follow him as their leader. His inherited title of Duke dictates that he is their lord, but their religion determines their real loyalty. He has to, quite literally, fight for every ounce of their trust. Indeed, it does not come cheap, and will only be given to one who is a member of their people.



Thus, Paul becomes their saviour. Consequently, he receives heaps of character development through this book. He goes form boy to the revered leader of a nation. The Fremen, like Paul, want the evil Baron Harkonnen gone from their planet. They do no want a cruel oppressor who is ignorant to their ways: they want Paul. I think the imagination behind the Fremen culture really is wonderful. They have efficiently adapted to survive their harsh planet. To emphasise this point you need only look at the fact that off-world humans live in fear of the giant Sandworms that infect the planet whereas the Fremen ride them as a coming of age ritual. Indeed, Paul has to ride a worm if the Fremen are to follow him.





The result of this is a very complex, and intriguing plot. I found the first third of this book to be very perplexing initially. This is a world we are told about rather than shown at the start. We hear about the Fremen but do not truly understand them till the very end. I was very overwhelmed at the beginning, and in all honesty I do think this novel merits a re-read to further establish my understanding of it. This did affect my rating because it inhibited by enjoyment of the book.



Indeed, aside from Paul there is a whole host of dynamic, and well rounded, characters. His mother is to be the new revered mother of the Fremen people, which for someone of her age is quite remarkable. There is also the captain of Duke Leto‚Äôs household guard who is a very deep and honourable individual. As much as I came to like these characters I was still frustrated with the writing of them in the beginning. I found it difficult to read scenes in which up to four characters internal thoughts are portrayed alongside their dialogue. It wasn‚Äôt always clear who was thinking. I much prefer a narrative that is focalised through one person. Well, at least one person per chapter.



Overall, I thought the idea behind this novel was utterly fantastic. However, my personal reaction to the writing style limited my overall enjoyment of the book. I do intend to read some of the sequels. However, I do not have any intention of doing so in the near future. Maybe, in a couple of years I will return to the brilliant, and annoyingly written, world of Dune.

Why You Should Read Dune (video): https://youtu.be/oOomSvGXfaM

Asking me to describe why Dune is so important to me is like asking a child to explain nuclear fusion. I do my best in the video linked above, but just know it probably isn't for the reasons you think.

My journey to Dune becoming my absolute favorite book of all time goes all the way back to the mid-1990's upon finding it in my high school library and deciding to give it a try because I remembered my dad and brother watching the movie when I was a kid. At 15 years old, I got to the middle of "book II" and gave it a big fat DNF. I decided it just wasn't for me. At 17, for the 30th anniversary, I decided to try again and while I finished it that time, I thought the ideas were overly pretentious and way too out there. But a year went by and somehow, it was still in my head. I thought about it frequently and I began to ponder...did I actually really like it?

I tried again the final weeks of my senior year of high school and became absolutely obsessed and it has stayed that way for almost the last 25 years.

Dune is social science-fiction in that it's more concerned with the people and society than it is with hard science. Besides telling you that these navigators "fold space" for interstellar travel, Herbert doesn't bog you down with the math. He focuses more on the politics, cultures, religion, and philosophies of a world rich in the most valuable resource in the known universe, but barren in everything else.

If you go into the story expecting a Star Wars style adventure, you're going to leave disappointed. Dune is extremely thought provoking and deals with the struggles of coming of age while the fate of the universe is on your shoulders.

I'll also say that the book is certainly not for everyone. If you love things like ASOIAF and The Wheel of Time, there is no way this book won't be for you as both of those series borrowed heavily from the story Frank crafted. But I think it truly depends on where you are at in your life. Look, I just told you the story of how it took until my third reading for this to really click with me. Those who the story and lessons click with, it REALLY clicks with. But, again, this isn't a crowd pleaser and not everyone is going to love it, especially modern readers. So while I encourage those that are interested to read it, I expect more modern readers to not like it than like it.

Not only is this the greatest science-fiction story of all time, but I believe it should be on mandatory reading lists in schools and everyone interested in the genre owe it to themselves to read the pillar of the genre they have come to love. Dune is every bit to science-fiction what Lord of the Rings is to fantasy.

‚ÄúI have seen a friend become a worshiper, he thought.‚Äù
I don‚Äôt think I actually *enjoyed* this book. But I certainly respected the hell out of it. For a bit I thought I had it all figured out, pegged it as your bog-standard Chosen One story, and then it went where I didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd go and neatly subverted my expectations. It tackled stuff that is uncomfortable and therefore is generally handwaved over in the usual SF epics. And for that I seriously respected this dense complex tome.

. We give those leaders tremendous power to lead and decide and determine fates. So many stories rooted in the weight of our species collective history glorify this; so many countries still apparently yearn for powerful visionary leaders that others proclaim to be dictators. So many religions go to wars over the legacy left by a popular charismatic leader centuries ago, interpreting those legacies as the engine for the action, destruction, obedience.

Hero worship. Messianic worship. Prophecies and tyrannies. Desire for a Savior to rescue you from the evil. Good intentions paving the road to hell.



This is a novel of a reluctant Messiah, the journey of a man becoming the Chosen One ‚Äî but unlike the traditional story of a charismatic savior, . The book ends in an ambiguous place, and I presume the sequels may develop the theme or run away from it and make this a more traditional hero journey. But I certainly hope not. . We love our ideas of ideal benevolent rulers who can set things right, don‚Äôt we? Or the martyr figures inspiring ‚Äúrighteous‚Äù battles? Messiahs and figureheads seem to fulfill the deep-seated cultural longing for an inspirational leader, don‚Äôt they? .





Yes, in Frank Herbert hints at the dangers present in such ideas. What seems like your traditional hero‚Äôs journey turns out darker and more sinister. But it‚Äôs not the rise of an antihero either. It‚Äôs subtler than that, without actually being all that subtle.

A son of a planetary Duke (because an interstellar post-technology future is actually feudal) and a highly trained Bene-Gesserit concubine of the Duke
, Paul fits very well the idea of a Messiah of the tribal resilient society of , neatly fulfilling their religious prophecies
and possessing genetic superpowers himself, augmented by rigorous training and catalyzed by the ingestion of a magical wonder-drug known as .

But Paul through his prescient powers can see what his mythologized destiny leads to. And there is not a way to escape it, once your life fits the mysticism of their faith (even if the faith and prophecies were stealthily prereplanted for sort of a similar purpose). Religious fanatics are destined to wage a brutal war that the Messiah is unable to stop.



All this is gently hinted at, laid out in the framework of the appealing Hero‚Äôs journey. It seems that should you desire, you can still easily choose to read it as a typical hero‚Äôs/antihero‚Äôs story, just less idealistic than it could be. But that would be Star Wars and not .



And you also can‚Äôt help but be mesmerized by a harsh desiccated planet where life is focused on survival, where not even water but mere moisture is the most coveted and rarest thing, where hopes for a better, wetter, greener future quietly flourish, tied into messianic ideas but grounded in science. The place of nightmares, written vividly and skillfully, making me want to gulp down a gallon of drink just because I can,

The world is harsh, unforgiving, brutal, hostile. The characters - well, mostly Paul, but to an extent his mother Jessica as well - are cold, calculating, composed and often very unsympathetic. Paul‚Äôs father values lives over property. Paul‚Äôs actions, on the other hand, lead to eyebrow-raising among his father‚Äôs old lieutenants who note the difference in priorities:


It‚Äôs dense and complex, full of politics, short on actual science fiction but full of ruminations on human nature ‚Äî and it leaves me feeling that all of this is a beginning of another cycle of violence, just with a new figurehead at the mast. As Terry Pratchett said, . All while sandworms quietly slither under the sand.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Oh yeah, there are sandworms, too.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

out of respect for Herbert‚Äôs subversive story that made me think. I‚Äôm content with the story ending here, with ambiguity and dread for what‚Äôs to come.

Seems as if they might be duned to be addicted to spice, all good old barbarians on magic mushrooms style.

Quite dusty, especially regarding how to put the different parts of this behemoth series in the big picture of sci-fi because each part (of the 3 I¬¥ve read so far and very probably won¬¥t restart trying to read the 4th and 5th part) presents something different. Essentially, only this, the first one, is a real science fantasy epos, while the others are mostly circulating around the characters' special skills and family problems without much meta, plot, or different settings.

Just this first milestone is big in the epic worldbuilding department and some other things I¬¥ll try to point my primate fingers at. As unrealistic as water scarcity in such a highly developed galactic civilization seems, it¬¥s a perfect explanation for creating the blue eyed mind mutants and the misandrist female breeding gang, that don¬¥t ever need to kick male butts, because they preemptively avoid that situation to become real.

Real life implications and innuendos.
I don¬¥t know if Herbert had any kind of real civilizations, cultures, or traditions in mind when he constructed the tribes, today it would probably fall under any kind of politically correct bigoted do gooder codex, but there could lie a ton of creative writing gold in exploring this question of how to implement any past or present movement, society, tradition, faith into different sci-fi subgenres. Because how the traditions, monsters, and badass special moves of the inhabitants influence the planetary and intergalactic trade and travel balance is slowly presented to the reader, while the impact of the wonderful spice expands its glow towards total domination.

Don¬¥t take drugs except they make you superhuman
As so often, a prescription free pharmaceutical wonder cure can solve all of your problems until corporate interests come and ruin everything by using anything in their armory to get control over the precious resource of psychohistoric psi precognition power. The idea of one substance changing the whole balance of power of the galaxy is big in many sci-fi series and especially terrifying for each arrogant, high tech civilization, because an animal creating impervious shields, an immortality tonic, a mind altering super drug, etc., could enable far weaker, steampunky tribes to destroy them. Classic barbarian hordes on magic mushrooms looting Rome style.

Bene Gesserit
Who says that centuries long, epigenetic, elitist breeding programs have to be completely evil all the time? Except for the poor lovers aroused by the wrong, not arranged partner, stupid Romeo and Juliet syndrome complexes, you have to see the bigger picture and control your hormones and feelings and sacrifice some biochemical illusions to create the √úberPsi mentat mentalist mind penetrator. However, it works with less evil too. Together with the spice, this elite mental mind control academy with the aim to finally create the ultimate space JC messiah figure to defecate rainbows, freaking galactic peace, pink unicorns, and gold, is the backbone of the whole trilogy, because impacts of both and the excessive use of it as MacGuffins and Chekhovs plot devices lead to the question:

Is this still really sci-fi or not more a high fantasy thing with some sci-fi elements?
Well, highly subjectively, yes, Dune is mostly psi fantasy dressed in futuristic clothes with some faith, tech, technobabble (rare), and trade in between, which makes it one of the most outstanding and unusual sci-fi works, I mean fantasy camouflaged as sci-fi. Tricky, one is so indoctrinated to call this thing sci-fi that it took me a reread and absorbing many reviews to realize what¬¥s really going on. I¬¥m really not sure about this whole thing, I¬¥ve read a ton of sci-fi and my alien mind parasite, in a kind of perverted symbiosis with the xenovirus making me look fresher I deliberately bought for this purpose like a tapeworm therapy to lose weight (you don¬¥t want to know what this costs on the alien bioweapons black market, the second half of my immortal soul exactly), tells me that there still would a lot of story without the sci-fi elements, while close to nothing would be there after removing fantasy, faith, drugs, and mind penetrating abilities, so, yea. I mean, even the planet itself doesn¬¥t really has sci-fi fractions or something, the space around it is kind of empty without many sci-fi parties, cyborgs, aliens, everything substantial seen in close to any big sci-fi series. This leads me to

An unpopular and possibly controversial opinion
It could be that Herbert is, and I am just talking about the sci-fi aspect, a bit overrated or, let¬¥s precisely define it, overhyped as a sci-fi author because he is more of a fantasy writer. This couldn¬¥t happen in a fantasy world, because parts of the legions of readers of the genre don¬¥t want aliens and Clarketech mixed in their magic, not to speak of the suspension of disbelief problem that often comes with sudden future tech elements in fantasy, that¬¥s just disgusting. The other way round, as with Dune, is much easier, just put some sci-fi around fantasy and everything just rolls perfectly.

Is terraforming destroying cultural heritage or making inhabitable worlds paradises?
The ethical implications of this question are another sci-fi old school vehicle, especially if the terrible acid rain, high gravity, parasite infested, or dirty desert land is the only region where the special, red plotline device can grow and thrive. One could go so far as to ask if there are real life examples on earth, conservation vs corporate environmentalism, greenwashing and stuff (spoiler warning: conservation lost, earth is dying), and how this should be dealt with in decades, centuries, or millennia when we (I hope you are immortal too thanks to alien symbiont virus cooperation like me, if you aren¬¥t, poor you, may I infect you? Just 20.000 of whatever your fringe financial system uses as fiat money that will be worthless as soon as natural apocalypse, mutually assured destruction, or alien invasion make it obsolete, and you get the parcel. Shipping not included.) start manipulating weather, geophysics and- chemistry, and climate of other worlds to make it sexy, tropical, tourist friendly paradises at the low cost of exterminating all alien life, but this would be a bit far fetched.

Herberts¬¥place in the sci-fi or sci-fa hall of fame.
That¬¥s tricky, especially because he just couldn¬¥t keep delivering after the third part. I¬¥ve played around with the fourth and fifth part, but had to abandon it because it escalated to too much unmotivated, philosophical drivel without a real plotline and a place in the big picture of the series, Herbert just didn¬¥t manage to hold it all together. What made the first three parts, that they are kind of eccentric, ingenious standalones without the classic space opera series uniting plotline and style, great, kind of destroyed the rest of the series. Because he had no more vision for the meta, high sci fa elements, Herbert lost control over his own creation and just manufactured hearthless shells to sell more books.

But that doesn¬¥t mean that the first three parts aren¬¥t milestones of the interdisciplinary genre, exploring it in new ways no one imagined before while reaching Lem-, Clarke-, and Asimov levels of subtle, intelligent dialogues, innuendos, connotations, and character driven development. It¬¥s something unique, special, and definitively not for anyone because of its high entry barriers that may annoy some readers, but don¬¥t let yourself be easily deterred by that, it¬¥s totally worth it once you¬¥re in and high as heck and addicted forever to the wonderful, delicious spice melange.

Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:

Dune is often considered a masterpiece of 20th-century American science fiction. In part, the book owes its reputation to the film adaptation David Lynch directed in the early 1980s (although this movie was, and still is, not considered one of his best). Frank Herbert wrote a novel of epic proportions, in other words, a space opera, with its intergalactic feudal society, its decadent (if not evil) empire and its band of rebels: the book was published some ten years before the first instalment of the Star Wars series. Indeed, along with Asimov‚Äôs (overrated) stories, it was George Lucas‚Äô primary source of inspiration.

One of the most exciting aspects of Herbert‚Äôs creation is the multi-cultural world he depicts. Each house (Atreides, Harkonnen, etc.), each planet (Arrakis, Giedi Prime, Caladan...), each group (the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit, the Guild, the Emperor‚Äôs suite and the Sardaukars) has its specific flavour, its own culture, its language ‚Äî the comprehensive index at the end of the book is utterly fascinating. For each of these cultures, Herbert borrowed traits from traditions (ancient or contemporary) he knew well in reality, especially from the Middle East. In particular, Paul Atreides / Muad‚ÄôDib‚Äôs story among the Fremen is redolent of the historical events around T.E. Lawrence and the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire. And Paul‚Äôs crusade on Arrakis is told, as though it were ancient history, in the chronicles at the start of each chapter.

Herbert describes his fictional world and characters in great detail, which contributes to the richness of his narrative, but I found these descriptions somewhat boring and, especially, the middle of the book is a bit dragging for that reason. In my view, the most impressive parts of this novel are the dialogues, where Herbert simultaneously reveals what the characters are saying and thinking. This technique lends a sense of duplicity and scheming to almost every interaction. Everyone is plotting one way or another so that the whole thing ends up being like a great Shakespearean play, with dialogues and asides, tyrants and pretenders. What confirms this impression is not only the theme of the exiled Duke (see , , or ), but also the repeated scenes of fencing duels throughout, with feints and poisoned tips: a clear allusion to the endings of and , for instance.

: A word about Denis Villeneuve‚Äôs new film adaptation of Herbert‚Äôs novel (part 1, 2021). Comparisons are odious and obviously wouldn‚Äôt be to David Lynch‚Äôs advantage. This is a version for a new generation of fans and an epic movie on par with Peter Jackson‚Äôs trilogy, in the early 2000s. The settings (filmed in Scandinavia and the Middle East) are breathtaking, and the actors have so much going for them. But what strikes me the most in this new version is the sense that everything is overwhelming and sublime: the massive architecture, the crushing machines, the extreme weather conditions, the earth-shattering landscapes, the thunderous music, the tragic events, the repulsive foes. From the relenting waves of Caladan to the searing and unending skies of Arrakis, everything assumes an oceanic and staggering dimension.

I blame the movie.

I was an avid but novice fantasy and sci-fi reader in 1984 when David Lynch‚Äôs Dune rolled out as a big-budget adaptation of the 1965 classic book. It was an artistic and box-office failure with Roger Ebert calling it ‚Äúa real mess, an incomprehensible, ugly, unstructured, pointless excursion.‚Äù Numerous references were made to its excessive length, particularly a tv edition that was over 3 hours long. I never did pick up the classic sci-fi book, assuming the commentary heard about the movie applied to the book. All that changed when I broke my finger and found myself with a lot of extra time on my hands (groan).

Besides,



Dune has a lot of ingredients that don‚Äôt fit into my preferred stories, yet the gestalt was not only tolerable, but engrossing.

It begins with the Atreides family preparing to shift their holding from their current home to the planet of Arrakis. The Emperor has given the Atreides the territory and trade on the planet of Arrakis, formerly under control of their enemies, the Harkonnen. The planet Arrakis is hot, arid and generally hostile to life. There is, however, a small population of native, fierce Freman who have managed to build an existence in the desert.



Paul Atreides is the young heir of the family, and mystical testing reveals he might be the one prophesied.



Paul undergroes a rapid growth curve, facilitated by his teacher Dr. Yeuh and his father‚Äôs advisors.



But it is in the desert that Paul will discover his strength as well as his new people.



Seriously, now.

Honestly, I have to wonder how much of this is generational. If Sanderson or Rothfuss wrote this book, two chapters in Dune would have made a whole book, and while detail may have been added, it likely would have made for a book as slow as the movie. I liked the scope of Dune, and that there is a resolution to the initial conflict. It is also interesting that despite the volume of concepts packed in here, with political maneuvers, terraforming, technology, cultural assimilation, and mysticism all playing roles that I didn‚Äôt find it overwhelming, perhaps because so much is genre-familiar.

On the downside, it could have perhaps used a bit more transitions, particularly near the end when months at a time are skipped. Writing was solid; nothing really stood out, but it told the story well. There‚Äôs some vague mysticism that might irritate those who like explanations. It was a bit of an eye-roller to have the chief villain be a fat, gay, sadistic pedophile, but Herbert really isn‚Äôt thinking outside the trope character box much (it‚Äôs not enough that he sentences people to death but he has to be physically abhorrent? And gay?). World-building is fun, but standard desert.

Overall, I‚Äôm glad that I finally took the time to read it and put those old assumptions to rest. I love a good hero.

[UPDATED]
I reread Dune for the first time in several decades and immensely enjoyed it. I also went back to watch the original cult feature film by David Lynch and had quite mixed feelings - while it was close to the overall aesthetic that Frank Herbert describes with the gorgeous desert sets and the terrifying worms, the parts of the story that were necessarily culled out was disturbing (that and the woeful special effects at the time trying (and IMHO failing) to visualize the personal shields that the characters wear in hand-to-hand combat).

For those who are just discovering Dune for the first time, it is essentially a messianic story on a desert planet (think of Jesus or perhaps Mohammed on Tatooine) in a universe dominated by a cartel (the Guild also known as CHOAM) with a monopoly on a drug (called m√©lange) derived from a rare material (spice) available only on the desert planet Arrakis (Dune). This drug is so powerful that it allows the Guild (and later Maud'dib) to leverage space-time singularities to defy the speed of light and travel anywhere in the universe. Overlaid on this foundation, the epic battle of the feudal houses of the noble Atreides and the evil Harkkonen houses rages, the betrayal of the former by the latter explicitly endorsed by the Emperor (himself an almost impuissant pawn of the Guild as well). All that to say that the fabric of the story is multilayered and as complex and complete a universe as you will find in George RR Martin or Dan Simmons.

There are several enhanced human species running around: the Mentats who have been cerebrally enhanced to be able to calculate like supercomputers (computers themselves having been banned!) and each then uses their predictive analytics for their assigned Dukes (or the Emperor) and the Bene Gesserit cult who are a sort of quasi-religious non-celibate nuns who have honed perception and language to the point of having developed nearly superpower-level strengths of persuasion which are almost universally feared and vilified as sorcery in the rest of the universe. Paul Atreides, heir to the throne, is born to Jessica, a Bene Gesserit, possessed some of these powers and when the family moves to Arrakis (part of the aforementioned Harkkonen plot) from their home planet Caladon, he appears to the native Freeman population as perhaps a fulfillment of their messianic prophecies and hopes.

In perhaps the most critical departure from the book, the Lynch movie does not really show Paul questioning the awesome power that he possesses and his assumption of the mantle as the Arrakis Messiah, the Maud'dib (something that the 2021 film by Denis Villeneuve does thankfully address). In the book, one aspect that I loved was how Paul struggled with this messianic destiny and did everything he could to subvert it. One of the unique gifts he received, presumably as the rare and unique offspring of a Bene Gesserit, was the ability to see possible outcomes (like a Mentat) and thus he could take decisions based on the most likely foreseen outcome. It made for great reading.

The other great thing about Dune is the aesthetic of this desert planet with impossibly huge worms under the surface who are mysteriously connected to spice and pose a danger to all creatures in the desert except for the Freeman. The still suit which recycles body water in the deep desert was brilliant as was the ever-present obsession with "water debt" of the Freemen. I really felt like I was walking unevenly (must not attract the worms!) through the sand with Jessica and Paul before their fateful encounter with the Freemen.

Dune is a well-deserved classic for all the reasons I mentioned above and probably much more that I missed. I have read it twice and gotten almost entirely different things out of it each time. I have since read all the canonical Frank Herbert books in the series and enjoyed it all immensely.

[UPDATE] I am looking forward to Denis Villeneuve's Dune in October 2021. The previews I have seen so far seem to be quite coherent with respect to the book. I was a fan of Lynch's Dune and am curious to see what Villeneuve does with this one. Feel free to comment below.
[UPDATE] Villeneuve‚Äôs 2021 film covers half of the book and does a fantastic job as both an homage to Herbert‚Äôs book and Lynch‚Äôs film. The casting, costumes, CGI, and script are all top-notch. Dune lovers have every reason here for rejoicing. One key difference from the Lynch film is that we do not see the Guild Navigators, so we can hope that they show up in the second half!

3.5/5 Stars

Dune oh Dune, seems like I need to raise my Shield Wall for this review.

Dune is one of the most important pieces of literature for the Sci-Fi genre. I‚Äôve been raking my brain for hours on how to properly explain the importance of Dune in the sci-fi literature but you know what? I dune (hehehe) think it‚Äôs necessary for me to do so. If you truly wanna know why, you can search it on whatever search engine you use and you'll find hundreds of articles or reviews on why this book is that important; and they‚Äôll do a much better job than me. I won‚Äôt even deny any of them because, in my opinion, this book was truly revolutionary. Dune didn‚Äôt become the number one highest selling Sci-fi novel of all time for no reason; like Brian Herbert said, it is to Sci-Fi, what the LOTR trilogy is to fantasy.

Theoretically, if I‚Äôm reviewing this by putting my head as someone from 1960‚Äôs or 1970‚Äôs, I know I would think of this book as my bible. 1965 was the year when Dune was published for the first time, 24 years before I was born. There are just too many groundbreaking ideas, world-building, that would become the inspirations for many Sci-fi in our time; I only realized this after reading this book. I mean, the gigantic Sandworm alone has inspired many video games to use it as a common monster or enemy.





Desert planet, Stillsuits, space exploration, and Zen Buddhism, Dune was truly a groundbreaking novel, almost everything in this book somehow seems prophetic because it has predicted our current society, especially when it comes to faith, emotional control, empathy, and the importance of ecology and scarcity.



Part of what made this book was great for me was Herbert‚Äôs prose. I haven‚Äôt read enough classic to claim it was classical, but Herbert‚Äôs prose was definitely unique to me. It has a lot of freedom by writing it from a limited omniscient narrative; changing POV‚Äôs repeatedly in a single chapter without any warning. This is, honestly, one of my biggest pet peeves in my usual read, but Herbert made it work because all his characters were really well written, distinct in their personality, and the dialogues are really well dune (HEHEHE). Plus, there are so many motivational and extremely philosophical quotes that seem to make this book a combination of Sci-Fi & self-help book, such as:



And of course, the most famous and one of the best quote I‚Äôve ever read out of any book



I can‚Äôt believe I have gone through life without knowing about this litany against fear. It‚Äôs applicable in any kind of hardship we faced in real life, and I know it will be one of my motto starting from now. If I‚Äôm judging this book solely from how significant this book was, I‚Äôll give it maximum score in a heartbeat. However, I‚Äôm reviewing this based on one question and how I rated all the books I read:

The answer is yes and no, it was a mixed bag. The first part of this book was incredible, I couldn‚Äôt put down the book and everything was so interesting and compelling. Then comes the second part, where the pacing just became really draggy and somehow, boring. However, my hope was restored for a while during the third act, until the anti-climax happened. My expectation is obviously at fault here but hey, this book is the number one highest selling sci-fi book of all time and one of the most highly acclaimed book, I expected there to be a mind-blowing climax sequences to close the book in an epic way. But no, there wasn‚Äôt any. Not only it felt anti-climactic, Herbert‚Äôs prose in describing settings and actions didn‚Äôt age well or up to current standard. The main reason for this is that this is a book that relies heavily on character‚Äôs dialogues to do everything; world-building, plot, characterizations were done solely through dialogues. This leads to the great plot but weak action sequences and no vivid settings. Sure there was some explanation on the settings, but other than the planet‚Äîwhich is just a desert, just search Sahara or Planet Tatooine and voila‚Äîthe interiors were given only brief description, which makes it hard to imagine; I had to look up some artworks to be able to immerse myself in the settings of the book.

Although there were some parts that disappointed me, I still liked the book and I finally understand why there are so much discussion and praises around this book. I recommend this to every Sci-fi fans for its importance and also, it‚Äôs good to know where most fantastic Sci-Fi you‚Äôve read or you‚Äôre reading now got its idea from. However, this is also where I‚Äôll stop with the series.

3.5/5

Honestly, I never know exactly how to start my review after finishing a nearly nine hundred pages book, but I guess I'll start by saying that I definitely enjoyed it, but was it a life-changing reading experience? Unfortunately, not for me. This book is considered a classic of the science fiction genre, Frank Herbert did an amazing, or even one of a kind job, creating the entire universe in which Dune takes place, all the characters, descriptions and practically everything in this book was simply fascinating. I really wanted to be one of those people who closes this book and is completely in love with it, and then when someone asks if they've read it say "Yeah, I love Dune, it's my favorite book." but as it turns out, I'm not that person. At least, yet. This is the first story in a six-volume series, so I hope that changes.


Like I said, I liked it, but I genuinely think I would have loved it if I hadn't watched the movies. In my opinion, the movies are even a close-to-being-perfect adaptation of the Herbert‚Äôs work and pretty much everything that happened in the book also happened in the first two films - with some small changes and a few scenes were in a different order, but it didn't change the fact that I still very much enjoyed watching both of them. Dune I and Dune II, being great adaptations, unfortunately meant that watching them before reading the book wasn't the best idea as I was bored for most of the story because I just knew what was going to happen. The first four hundred pages took me the longest to read because I watched Dune I twice, but thankfully it took me much less to finish the rest. The beginning (read the said first four hundred pages) were hard to read - which may not be much of an incentive for those planning to start I know - but the second half of the book even got me hooked. Frank's writing style may not have been entirely to my liking, the "wow, what's happening" moments didn't shock me as much as I thought they would, but the characters were amazing so I have to thank them because they are the reason for me being invested. Jessica was definitely my favorite here, followed by Paul, which I know is a boring answer, but what can I say, I liked them. They may even have become my favorite son and mother duo in books, which says a lot considering I've read a lot of stories in my life.






Finally ending my rant, because I didn't plan to write so much, which is basically still nothing, because you could talk and talk without the end about this book, but I definitely plan to continuing this series. Maybe I'll even manage to finish all six books this year, we'll see. I hope at least.


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

maybe I'll be able to read all six books by the time the next movie comes out (2027?) we'll see (I'm already having trouble with all the names)

I have to write this review without rhythm so that it won‚Äôt attract a worm.

In the distant future Arrakis is a hellhole desert planet where anyone who doesn‚Äôt die of thirst will probably be eaten by one of the giant sandworms. It‚Äôs also the only place where the precious spice melange can be found so it‚Äôs incredibly valuable, and the honorable Duke Leto Atreides has been ordered by the Padishah Emperor to take over control of Arrakis from his mortal enemies, the House Harkonnen. While this seems like a great offer on the surface the Duke and his people realize that it‚Äôs actually a cunning trap being set by the Emperor and Baron Harkonnen.

The only hope seems to be allying with the local populace called Fremen whose harsh environment has led them to become an incredibly tough and disciplined people, but they have their own vision of what Arrakis should be. They also have a prophecy about the coming of a messiah figure who will lead them to freedom, and the Duke‚Äôs son Paul looks like he may be exactly who they‚Äôve been waiting for.

This is classic sci-fi that really deserves the label. What Frank Herbert accomplished in one novel is stunning because he built a fascinatingly detailed universe in which the politics, religion, economics, espionage, and military strategy are all equally important. He then blended these more grounded concepts with bigger sci-fi ideas like being able to use spice to see through space-time, and the scope of that encompasses trying to pick the proper path through various potential timelines as well as free will vs. fate.

I think one of the factors that helps this story stay timeless is that so much of it is based on what humanity becomes vs. trying to predict what futuristic technology would be like. This is a society that once had a war with machines and has since rejected any type of computers so people have developed to fill the gap with the help of the spice. The Mentats are trained to use data to predict outcomes. The Navigators of the Guild have used so much of the spice to help them move through space that they‚Äôre mutating. The all female Bene Gesserit have developed a variety of skills to place their members alongside positions of power to help advance their breeding scheme that spans generations. Herbert also cleverly came up with an excuse that explains why knives and hand-to-hand combat are so important with the idea of the personal body shields.

So even though we still got a good sci-fi‚Äôs novel worth of cool gadgets the emphasis is on what the people can do and how that‚Äôs developed over a long period of time. It also adds a lot of depth to the political dimensions because all of these groups have different agendas that cause them all to mistrust each other, but because they all fill these various roles none can exist without the others.

There are also parallels to our world that are still in play because the idea of a desert people caught up in the power struggles of various outsiders because of their valuable natural resource is an obvious allegory to the Middle East that still works today. Plus, the classic film came out a few years before Herbert published this, and you have to think that it had some influence on him because there are elements of the story that seem very much inspired by it.

While the whole concept of a Chosen One has gotten a bit worn over time that‚Äôs not Herbert‚Äôs fault, and this is still a fantastic sci-fi story with big ideas that also works as space opera as well as being an epic adventure story.

2024 Re-read

I have consumed the Water of Life and felt the spice agony.
It has revealed to me the error of my past ways. But as the Lisan al Gaib teaches us, ways can change.






A word of warning as you venture out to peruse the veritable smorgasbord of delectable reviews for this Sci-Fi/Fantasy Classic!
Be sure to do your Du(n)e diligence. Be wary of key phrases such as ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt usually read Fantasy/Sci-Fi‚Äù, ‚ÄúToo many made-up words‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just reading before the movie comes out‚Äù. These individuals have come down with a bad case of bandwagonitis and any self-respecting Sci-Fier-er cannot count on their reviews being in any way accurate or beneficial!
As I‚Äôm firmly placed in the 3rd category of Blockbuster-hungry fools, I‚Äôd advise you to immediately move on to another review, there‚Äôs nothing of value here. In fact, I won‚Äôt actually be writing a review, I‚Äôll simply address one simple question:




Dune is sand as far as the eye can see.
Dune is the sphincter opening.... of a desert tent.
Dune is thirst. The distillate esthers of reclaimed waste; the sour effluvia of humanity. It is greedily, no‚Ä¶ joyously sipping your overweight Uncle‚Äôs recycled knacker sweat in a desperate effort to quell the rapid loss of your own bodily fluid.
Dune is the Water of Life; Molecular Modification; a Transcendental Trinocular Acid Trip. The [Boy] with Kaleidoscope Eyes experiencing a Psychokinesthetic extension of self.
Dune is the middle-aged man who, on hearing praise for his young sons, must always exclaim "I taught them everything they know!"
Dune is defiance of fear.
Dune is an unsettling change in POV turned familiar, insightful friend.
Dune is saying very little with a great many words.
Dune is Pardot Kynes, micro-ecology, patience and long-term goals.
Dune is the Shai-Hulud; the scandalous straddling of a worm.
Dune is religion, planted and shaped to the needs of the latest conquests and heraldic symbols.
Dune is the Ghost Wind of the Jihad
Dune is Alia, is Stewie Griffin.
Dune is Feyd-Rautha, is Commodus playing Gladiator.
Dune is a feint, within a feint, within a feint.
Dune is the house Atreides, is the Greek house Atreus.
Dune is the Kwisatz Haderach; the Messiah; a planet afflicted by a Hero.
Dune is power and wisdom at the cost of humanity; Friendship lost to worship.

When the epic and ensemble cast movie of Dennis Villenevue is about to release, I decided to choose this fantastic and also one of my favorite cult sci-fi series as flashback Saturday reading! ( it looks better than David Lynch- Kyle MacLachlan version but the looks may be deceiving! At least Timothy and Zendaya look so cool in those stylish clothes and grimy expressions on their faces)

After nearly three decades later, holding this paperback into my hands is magical experience take me a time travel: my mom was banging on my room‚Äôs door and telling me go outside and be social, getting some tan, instead of self-isolating myself by burying my head into books for days and feeding myself with junk food! ( the past mom had no idea, billions of people in the earth will be forced to do the similar things I‚Äôve done in 2020 because of different reasons . At least the 2020-me did exactly same things with one difference: I threw boozes into equation! )

When I reread the series I clearly understand why I became addicted to the them( I‚Äôm talking about entire books)

Firstly you find yourself drawn into this journey after reading few pages because Herbert‚Äôs storytelling skills are extraordinarily. The meaningful interludes, the character development, the impressive world building transform you to the other universe that you never want to leave.

The awakening parts of Paul who discovers his own abilities, epic dynasty battles, ominous sand worms , intrigues, revenge, mind games present us a perfect blend of political economical, sociological, theological themes.
I advise you to read the books first to understand the deeply ideological messages and unique philosophy of the series because sometimes the screenwriters have hard time to absorb and reflect the entire soul of the book! At least by reading the main story by yourself, you may directly reach to the core!

Here are my favorite quotes of the book:

‚ÄúI must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.‚Äù

‚ÄúDeep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen religion and politics travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way. Their movements become headlong - faster and faster and faster. They put aside all thoughts of obstacles and forget the precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it's too late.‚Äù

‚ÄúHope clouds observation.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is impossible to live in the past, difficult to live in the present and a waste to live in the future.‚Äù

‚ÄúFear is the mind killer.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnce men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.‚Äù

Dune (Dune Chronicles #1), Frank Herbert

Dune is a 1965 science fiction novel by American author Frank Herbert.

In the far future, humanity has eschewed advanced computers due to a religious prohibition, in favor of adapting their minds to be capable of extremely complex tasks.

Much of this is enabled by the spice melange, which is found only on Arrakis, a desert planet with giant sand-worms as its most notable native life-form.

Melange improves general health, extends life and can bestow limited prescience, and its rarity makes it a form of currency in the interstellar empire.

Melange allows the Spacing Guild's Navigators to safely route faster-than-light travel between planets, and helps the Reverend Mothers of the matriarchal Bene Gesserit to access their Other Memory, the ego and experiences of their female ancestors.

TW: pedophilia and rape off page

Although this is discussed as a highly influential work in scifi, now having read it, I do think we have evolved past the need for this to be part of the canon. This book was a bit of a mess with the characters, world, and plot all feeling a bit disjointed and half baked. The world, while interesting and obviously very detailed, is barely explained to the reader and relies heavily on the appendix without actually providing context in the story (with the exception of a few things like spice and the worms). These characters all felt a little flat and/or underutilized. The plot felt like two separate books, while being peppered with themes of glorifying colonialism, white saviors, and lack of agency for most of the women. Although I understand that is a product of when it was written, it still points to how there are much better works that have been written since even if they were influenced by this. I‚Äôm interested to see what they do with the movie adaptation. I‚Äôll have a review and discussion on my channel coming up.

8-3-2024: part 2 was esthetically pleasing and raises interesting questions on leadership and followership, and the price of power.
15-9-2021: saw the movie tonight and loved it‚Äôs esthetics and how it conveys the gravitas of the story

Like medieval (but the Islamic enlightenment version of it) times, a caste system and the oil industry imposed upon space opera, with mystical elements permeating the whole and simultaneously telling the rise of a Napoleon like hero. Dune sounds like a book that shouldn‚Äôt work, but does, in an unique, complex and compelling manner.





The last 25% of the book was a wild ride that really upped my enjoyment of this reread, and left me impressed with the worldbuilding and boldness of .
But to start: is a classic in the scifi field, but is quite atypical. Technological progress has stalled after a jihad against thinking machines (aka computers) and a kind of medieval society in space has emerged. An emperor reigns, planets are dished out as fiefs and mysterious sects () follow their own paths to influence events. Some kind of social darwinism is at play, and the conviction that humanity can be massively better (or worse) is we return our attention to oneself instead of towards technology.

The terms are at the start quite hard to get into, even though I know the story and remember some of them from last time reading the book. Arrakis, the Dune from the title, is an other interesting thing. This desert planet is almost a separate character (), being handed to the Atreides duke and worsening a blood feud with the Harkonnens, the previous owners of the planet.

It is interesting how Herbert decided to reveal the first murder plot perpetrator quite soon, showing evidently that this is a book more about ideas then tension.
In general the book is biblical in language and the weight assigned to events, with foreshadowing and myths. The world feels rich and alive.

The main character is Paul Atreides, the son of duke Leto. He is groomed to take on his role of leader of a major house, and by his Bene Gesserit mother Jessica (who is, for lack of a better analogy, a kind of crossing between a martial arts expert, nun and witch). There are several other retainers, who are depicted in a manner that I can only compare to .
The characters in general feel greater than life, for instance the level of perception and deduction at the dinner party is superhuman, I can only imagine because there is no advanced technology that the psychic training must somehow become more advanced and leads to the kind of casual analysis Jessica and Paul are capable of.

The fall of house Atreides is still a brutal event, even if you know it is coming and feels swift and unexpected, as does Paul‚Äôs enlightenment.




To be fair, halfway in the book I felt a kind of lull in reading. The main characters are thrown back upon themselves and need to establish themself amongst the Freemen, Bedouin like desert folk who are much more powerful than thought.
In these sections there is such a sensitivity to culture and worldbuilding, Tatooine or the Aiel of are nothing compared to the depth Herbert manages to bring go Arrakis and its Freemen. So much must have been thought of but has been left out, given a richness in the world conjured that is only rivaled by Middle Earth.

The scenes are intense, and well written, but in way a bit dull since the ascent of Paul to power seems assured. There is banter that is really sharp, like:


And Paul is shown as doubting, self aware of his rise and what it entails, commenting on heroism and mythmaking, and the restraints to his powers: ()

But the third part, especially to the end, shows real boldness by skipping two years and taking on tragic events (), sometimes only in an indirect manner.
Alia is a good example, and all the implications and struggles, guilt, she must bring with her. You feel it, it is touched upon, but never in an on the nose manner.
And the development of the relationship between Stilgar and Paul also carries sadness and an awareness of the corrosive power of adoration and myth:

The epicness of both the story and main character Paul (and a shoutout to Chani and Jessica as well) is just beyond anything.
For instance somewhere near the end Paul responds the following to a warning that the galactic emperor is coming down upon him in force:



Decadence as an indication of ineffectiveness and decline, while orthodoxy, returning to the core of human struggle for life, is a way out of the impasse, comes back as a theme.

The actual enlightenment and power of Paul as gained by the spice is unknowable to a reader, since he operates on another level entirely. Time being a dimension, Paul transcends the three dimensions and becomes something inhuman along the way, a singularity like the technical singularity.





Ok√©, what is this convenient weirding suddenly along the way?
Why is count Fenring there, what does he add in anyway to the story?
And how the hell does Paul get nuclear weapons all of the sudden.
And as said: the second part of the book really did not speak that much to me.

But in no way it can be denied that the world conjured by Dune is rich, bold and interesting, and that I very much look forward to see the movie in 2021!

As a teenager, ‚ÄòDune‚Äô blew my mind. I fell into the story and loved all the grandiose ideas. Over time, I reread the novel at least a half dozen times and read the follow-on novels. Looking back over time, I idolize it a bit less, recognizing some flaws, but it will always have a special place in my literary heart. For me, it's still one of the very best.

‚ÄúA beginning is a very delicate time.‚Äù

From a literary standpoint, my favorite thing is how it throws us in the middle of a universe 20,000 years in the future and makes no attempt to explain the backstory. And there is an incredibly rich backstory. There is a spacefaring Old Empire, which became corrupt and fell. There was an AI Superintelligence that enslaved mankind, only to be overthrown, itself, leaving a universe where technology is used scarcely and carefully such as human computers knows as mentats. There is the founding of the Bene Gesserit religious cult, a collection of women whose goal is to manipulate mankind towards stability and enlightenment. None of this is clearly explained in the original novel, which really pushes the reader to deep curiosity and to make many inferences. It‚Äôs this iceberg approach which gave me the most joy when reading it.

‚ÄúFear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me."

From a science fiction standpoint, it‚Äôs filled with wonderous ideas ‚Äì alien creatures (sandworms), space travel, cool ornithopter craft, and of course the trippy, psychic power-inducing spice! So, despite having to infer all the intricate backstory, we do get to experience firsthand an imaginative, fully realized alien future.

‚ÄúHe who controls the spice, controls the universe.‚Äù

So, what are the flaws? Well, perhaps the biggest, which it shares with many epic western stories (Last of the Mohicans, The Last Samurai, Dances with Wolves, Avatar, etc.) is the ‚Äòwhite savior‚Äô trope. I think it‚Äôs a valid criticism, but in Dune, Paul embraces the Fremen culture and does not try to change them or tell them how to live. This is addressed more deeply in the follow-on novels, as well. Another is treatment of women (largely - through the Bene Gesserit) as conniving and manipulative. In addition, women are used for marriage to develop alliances. Finally, one could make a case that the book explores eugenics, possibly the most problematic issue. It‚Äôs not far off from the concerns in Star Wars with midichlorians and the Skywalker bloodline. I personally find it difficult to defend any type of eugenics as an ethical plot device.

‚ÄúIrulan shall be my wife, opening the way for an Atreides to take the throne.‚Äù

However, on the positive side, the plot has some real strengths. It‚Äôs clearly anti-colonialist and pro-environmentalist long before it was cool to be those things. It questions the powers of church and state and examines the implications of culture-clash. It examines how religion affects politics, and politics affect religion. Capitalistic greed is cast in a very ugly light. One might even call it anti-western thinking. There are strong female characters with intelligence and real power. And, through its backstory, it also examines the dangers of overreliance on technology.

‚ÄúThe willow submits to the wind and prospers until one day it is many willows‚Äîa wall against the wind. This is the willow‚Äôs purpose.‚Äù

Despite what your jeweler will tell you, no diamond is truly flawless. ‚ÄòDune‚Äô remains a masterpiece, in scale, ideas, and storytelling. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs influential and entertaining. Five sand blown stars for this epic, complex, and well-told masterpiece.

Dune is a disappointment, given the recent hype due to the upcoming movie. It's aged really badly. People everywhere are reading the book, and I wonder if they see what I realised when I reread it.

The book is an ego massage to the writer, Frank Herbert. He wrote his best book never knowing the - bad - influence it would have over the sci fi scene. I think Dune is overrated and bloated.

I gave the book 5 stars on my first read of it. The reread sank any adulation I might have professed to the book. The movie is going to flop, unless, i.e. the covid factor messes with the numbers. Go ahead, movie Dune. Go claim your fetid throne in the landscape of films, just as book Dune did for books. See if I care.

He disfrutado con este libro exactamente lo mismo (o m√°s) que la primera vez que lo le√≠.
Las aventuras de Paul Atreides, destinado a ser un aut√©ntico mes√≠as y salvador de Arrakis, me han vuelto a emocionar y sorprender.
Simplemente este libro tiene todo lo que me gusta:
-Personajes muy carism√°ticos (destacando OBVIO Jessicca, la princesa Irulan, el bar√≥n Harkonnen y Alia)
-Un original y muy bien desarrollado (Desde la creaci√≥n de Arrakis y los Fremen con su cultura tan particular, compleja y cre√≠ble, al universo gal√°ctico, esos Harkonnen tan romanos decadentes, esas Bene Gesserit p√©rfidas y maravillosas)
-Una y no se estanca nunca (llena de giros, sorpresas, acci√≥n... pero no falta de pensamientos metaf√≠sicos)
- (intrigas palaciegas y trepidantes movimientos pol√≠ticos)
-Una intenci√≥n final (sobre la manipulaci√≥n religiosa, la figura del mesias, el ecologismo..)

Vamos, este libro para mi sigue siendo un buen ejemplo de lo que es una historia bien contada, original, entretenida y que consigue al mismo tiempo darte que pensar y dejar poso.

Sin duda voy a , esta vez s√≠, el universo que crea Herbert es tan rico e interesante que no puedo quedarme as√≠ (aunque el final de este libro es completamente cerrado).

Welcome to Unpopular Review Time! Where I go against what almost everyone else says about a book.

Before we start, please do not be fooled by the three star rating. Even if I didn't like really like the book, I have to acknowledge there are reasons why Dune is a cornerstone of the Sci Fi genre.

Now, let's talk about the important stuff.



We get a new planet, and while it's obvious that Herbert based his desert planet on real sights and cultures, it's still awesome. The Fremen and their culture, the stillsuits, the worms, the plight for water... It's all explained in such a vivid detail without being boring or repetitive. And while reading you can see the references! Can we talk about how many movies and books have been influenced by this?



We also get a future Empire where machines are no longer used for computation purposes. Instead, humans have been trained to unlock their full brain potential and make such calculations. And we get two schools of these "enhanced" humans: the Bene Gesserit and the Mentats. And we get lots of details explaining this new society: the Empire, the Noble Houses, the Guild, how each group interacts with the others, the intrigue surrounding all dealings...



Paul, is the 'Chosen One', the Lisan al-Gaib, the Kwisatz Haderach. He gets many names. After a betrayal, he finds refuge among the Fremen and seeks revenge from those who wronged his house.



Here comes my first problem with the book, you can divide it in a before and after around the betrayal point. (I'm not spoiling anything by telling you this, believe me, the book will tell you ALL about it)

The story is told in a third person omniscient point of view, and the author uses this liberally, giving us a peek into the different characters' thoughts. And he loves repeating ideas. So we get to know about the betrayal from the bad guy who planned it, from the traitor himself, from everyone inside House Atreides who knows that there's a traitor and suspects everyone,... and all this before anything actually happens! When the scene finally rolls in I was so tired of the plot I almost gave up on the book.

After this the plot actually picks up and there's lots of action. However I had some more problems with it, as I'll explain ahead.

While they were all artfully created and developed;

The way Herbert planned his 'Chosen One' and his society, most of the characters are deeply logical and, dare I say, stuffy? They think and re-think, and plan and plot, and think again, computing everything with a very small dose of humanity. (Ha! And they call themselves humans.)

Paul is wise beyond his years, not only by his training, but by his evolution during the story. It made me think of another chosen child: Harry Potter, but where we all wanted to be Harry, or at least one of his friends; I really had no thought of befriending this one. (I did pity him a lot.)

And then there's the bad guy! Oh Gods. I've never in my life seen such a TERRIBLE antagonist and I don't say this lightly.



He's a fat ugly guy, who cannot even move himself. He's a pedophile, a slave worker, treats everyone horribly including his own family. There is absolutely no redeeming quality to this guy. He's almost cartoonish in how bad he is.

And I never ever got his hate for the Atreides, I can understand greed, personal vendettas, house wars. But his hate seemed too personal and at the same time too huge to be understandable. Also, he was the typical movie villain that loved to rehash his plots over and over again, and brag about how cunning he was. Complete freaking waste of time.

Last, but not least. and I DID NOT like it. Call me romantic, call me naive, call me soft. I don't care. I thought that last paragraph was the wrong thing to say.

I suggest you read it. If only so you can see Star Wars in a pretty different light.

I‚Äôve been sitting at this keyboard for longer than I care to admit trying to coalesce my thoughts about Dune into something coherent. You already know it‚Äôs fantastic though, right? Dune is one of those novels that is spoken of in reverential tones by seasoned reader and relative newbie alike. It‚Äôs considered by many to be THE best sci-fi novel of all time and Herbert‚Äôs son, Brian Herbert, rightfully calls it sci-fi‚Äôs equivalent to Lord of the Rings for inspiring all that came after its publication.

So, I mean, what in the name of Shai-Hulud am I supposed to add to that?

Well, I‚Äôll begin with the story of how I came to read . I‚Äôm sure that there have been ample opportunities to read the book. I can remember seeing the black-spine amidst a forest of other spines on my cousin‚Äôs bookshelf, of which I had free reign. Yet something always kept me from picking it up. It could have been my obsession with fantasy novels at that time with only the briefest allowances for sci-fi. Whatever the reason, the book continued to pop up. Its sliver of desert on a black background called to me from piles at used bookstores, the shelves of friends and relatives, and even on public transportation. All the same, I never got around to it.

Two factors finally made the difference. The first, my well-read friend (Josh Bragg in real life, but he‚Äôs on Goodreads too!) always brought it up as one of the best books he‚Äôs ever read. He also took the opportunity to remind me to read it whenever book recommendations went flying between us and, foolishly, I kept putting him off. But I‚Äôm a sucker for a great looking book and these Penguin Galaxy sci-fi collections sealed the deal for me. Their elegant cover designs, the intros by Neil Gaiman, a selection of books I‚Äôd always been meaning to read, AND was on it? I was absolutely delighted to find the book under the tree on Christmas morning and tore into it in earnest.



Though it took near 200 pages to really pick up speed, the novel had me hooked from its immersive opening. Here was a world that was familiar and strange at the same time. There are elements of fantasy and religion coupled with interplanetary travel and space empires. The characters touted titles that were inscrutable at the beginning, but became part of my vocabulary before the novel‚Äôs end. The novel refused to tell me everything I needed to understand, secreting mysteries without ever outright stating them. How could I not want to know what Kwisatz Haderach meant? How could I not want to know the secrets of Arrakis?




I was swept away by this novel that mixes sci-fi concepts of higher dimensions with political intrigue. Environmental change mixed with an unlimited cast of enthralling characters, and a drop of religious philosophy. is a novel of the highest order: it combines entertainment with brilliant questions that pull from an incredible number of disciplines. Of course, if you just want to read a compelling tale of political plotting, murder, adventure, and discovery, you can totally do that too.

In the afterword, Brian Herbert notes a conversation he had with his father about the writing and structure of . Frank Herbert constructed so that it would be immensely dense. Herbert wanted to create a tale that could be enjoyed on the level of the central conflict: a boy becoming a man trying to reclaim his heritage against astounding odds in a world beyond imagining. Here‚Äôs an excerpt from that afterword about the layers.



The fact that the novel can be enjoyed from any number of different readings alone makes it a novel of huge significance. doesn‚Äôt force you into thinking, but it invites the interested to partake in its rich metaphor and multifaceted meaning. What‚Äôs more, Herbert makes statements about his concepts, but rarely does he offer them as the only solution (barring, perhaps, an ecological viewpoint that bemoans industrialization). I dove into different fields of thought between and during readings. I contemplated elegant ideas Herbert proposes and marveled at the structure of the plot and the boundless ideas of this world.

What a world it is! The world building here could fill a university course as Herbert establishes a world unlike any other, but totally believable. When I read about the stillsuit I was astonished by its creativity, but also how it imparted valuable information about the world of Arrakis. Though the sandworms scream for attention throughout the novel, equal care is given to the hierarchy of the Empire, the mystical Bene Gesserit religion, and the curiosities of culture. Herbert also seems to have invented a group of hallucinogenic compounds that are in equal parts trippy, interesting, and betray an interesting look at 1960s culture.



Of course, when the ride does end, it is immensely satisfying. ends leaving unanswered questions in a fashion that made me feel like I knew enough to be entirely contented. Which, of course, begs the question: will I read the other novels?

Welllllllllllllllll, maybe.

It‚Äôs highly daunting to look at the entire and think that I would tackle that. Especially when ends in a way that makes me so happy, and especially when the subsequent novels purportedly deliver diminishing returns. For now, I‚Äôm too overjoyed and impressed by to consider returning to the world anytime soon other than to re-read the novel.

Obviously, I can‚Äôt recommend enough. That‚Äôs also not a recommendation that goes to the sci-fi crowd alone. Oh no, this is a book that has great appeal to a wide variety of people. You like ? Perfect: you‚Äôll love the backstabbing, the plots-within-plots, the combat, the story. You don‚Äôt read sci-fi? No worries: there‚Äôs a wealth of important themes upon which to reflect. You like sci-fi, your friends continuously recommend you read , and you keep putting it off?

Goodreadians, I think you know what you need to do!

Dune is one of the best examples of the hero‚Äôs journey in fiction. Most authors, myself included, need more than one book in order to tell an epic coming-of-age story. Herbert did it in one while also creating a unique and interesting setting. Part of his genius as an author was his ability to imply far more about his world than he actually showed. As a result, Dune feels as if it was written by an inhabitant of Herbert‚Äôs universe; no small achievement.

As with goes beyond the usual surface elements that so much of fiction relies upon. It deals with questions of leadership, ecology, and philosophy (and so much more) while also telling a darn good story.

And it contains one of my favorite quotes:

‚Äú
Fear is the mind-killer.
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
Only I will remain.‚Äù

The book does have some flaws (the death of Muad‚ÄôDib‚Äôs son is dealt with too quickly, and the only homosexual character is the villain), but even with them, is a masterpiece.

Like most of my five star books, I‚Äôve read Dune multiple times. In fact, I‚Äôd say that what makes a book more than just enjoyable and instead truly amazing is that you want to read it more than once and are rewarded for doing so. I‚Äôve probably read Dune six times, and I‚Äôve never gotten tired of it but my understanding of the work has increased over time.

To begin with, the first time I read Dune, I got about three pages into it, realized I didn‚Äôt understand a thing and that I was hopelessly confused. I had to go back and reread what I had read, and then go back again and reread the whole chapter. I would excuse myself by saying that I was 10, but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one that has had that experience. Don‚Äôt be dismayed if it happens to you - whether 10, 18, or 45. If you are confused at first, consider that Paul is also confused and finds so much that happens strange and new. Understanding will come in its proper time.

At one time at least, there was a fairly famous website (at least among geeks) that humorously summarized books in thirty words or less. Maybe it still exists, but its name escapes me. The summary provided for Dune read something like this, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Frank Herbert and I‚Äôm a lot smarter than you are.‚Äù When I was younger, this would have seemed a fair appraisal of the work. One of the most central aspects of ‚ÄòDune‚Äô is Herbert manages to write convincingly about people whose intelligence is supposed to vastly exceed that of the reader. More than anything, to create a believable Messianic story, the writer has to create a Messiah possessing believable Messianic wisdom and insight, and Herbert succeeds at this invention probably better than any other writer. We come to believe that the protagonists do have deep and profound insight into the question of ‚ÄòLife, the Universe, and Everything‚Äô so that we do not immediately feel cheated and we are able to believe in the characters ‚Äì even someone like Maud‚ÄôDib. As I‚Äôve gotten older, and hopefully wiser, I‚Äôve come to see that Herbert is not in fact possessed of superhuman intelligence, but that he creates the illusion of superhuman intelligence by a variety of clever devices. The appearance of a superhuman intelligence and wisdom is really a sham and the pool is really pretty shallow, but even this revelation does not reduce the esteem in which I hold the work. It‚Äôs not Herbert‚Äôs real job to be a prophet: he‚Äôs an artist. Herbert succeeds brilliantly in what he should be judged on ‚Äì the ability to paint the illusion deftly and convincingly. If we acquire the sophistication to see through it, it shouldn‚Äôt reduce our appreciation of the artistic mastery used in creating it. I think now I would amend the summary of the work to be, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Frank Herbert, and I‚Äôm a lot better writer than you are.‚Äù

If all that could be said in Dune‚Äôs favor was that it had one of the most convincing invented prophets in literature, it would still be a worthwhile work. But Dune has abundant pleasures beyond the richly realized illusion of philosophical depth and even the deftly realized setting. Chief among these for me is the truly deep and intricate relationships Paul has with the other characters. There is a real depth of feeling here, and I love the way each of the complicated nuanced relationships is portrayed as we are introduced to the cast of Paul‚Äôs complicated life. Each character feels a deep mixture of feelings for Paul who is boy, man, friend, soldier, sovereign, and Messiah and much else. There is tenderness to this work. We sense that complexity and tenderness right from the start, when his mother allows him to be tortured and to face murder, and then immediately thereafter experiences profound hope and joy: ‚ÄúMy son lives.‚Äù We feel Paul‚Äôs boyish love for his friends and companions, who are also his father‚Äôs henchmen and his teachers and who he is in turn their future Lord. We feel the more mature manly love that these companions have for their young charge and future ruler. Even Yueh loves the boy he must destroy. We feel the boyish admiration Paul has for his father as he strains to be worthy of him and to make his father proud, and we feel the returned pride and satisfaction that his father feels. We feel the aching love of a boy for this Mother when he has already lost everything else when Jessica is buried in sand, and we feel her returned love when she says, ‚ÄúI knew you would find me.‚Äù

And though there love is only briefly on stage, still I find the love between Paul and Chani among the sweetest and most charming in literature. Who cannot thrill when scarcely knowing each other, but seeing their lives together stretching out before them both good and terrible, the young becoming but not yet lovers promise with tender vows nonetheless to be forever each other's comfort and joy and they feel their hitherto unseen future becoming a real solid now. Isn‚Äôt that how it is in some way for all of us when we meet the one who will be the one and we suddenly realize we want to and we will spend the rest of our lives together regardless of what will happen? And how often have we felt the total unabashed joy as Paul does when we know our lover is now near?

‚ÄúThat could only mean Chani was near by‚ÄîChani, his soul, Chani his sihaya, sweet as the desert spring, Chani up from the palmaries of the deep south.‚Äù

All that and ‚ÄòDune‚Äô is a wonderful exciting action adventure story filled with thrills and chases, fights and battles, and supersized edge of our imagination wonders. Worms.

It‚Äôs no wonder that this is one of the best beloved books of all time. If you haven‚Äôt read it, you should. If you have read it, read it again.

I MEAN ... WHERE THE FUCK DO I REALLY EVEN START??? It's been a long time since I've been sucked into a FANTASY / SCI-FI world and didn't wanna leave it. Early examples of that happening include Potter, the Ink world and Lord of the Rings (first through the movies, and later the books).

In recent years, it has only happened with A Song of Ice and Fire and The Kingkiller Chronicles ‚Äì two unfinished series ... a fate that DUNE, unfortunately, shares. [Can you hear me screaming all across the universe, Frank???]

Anyways, I stopped reading fantasy and sci-fi for the simple reason that I was no longer excited by it. I read so much from these genres over my young adolescence (most notably fantasy ... sci-fi was never really my thing) that it felt right to "move on" at one point. I never regretted it, and rarely look back.

BUT when I saw in theatres, I felt a like an excitable kid again. That movie had me hooked. From the first minute on, I knew I would be going on one hell of a ride. I saw the film with my best friend and we both couldn't believe what we had just witnessed. Cinema history akin to (or at least that's how I imagine the people who got out of the cinema back in the early 2000s). This is a FRANCHISE that one can work with. This is something that will stick with us for the next couple of years, especially if they make TWO more movies (instead of just one).

didn't have that typical sci-fi feel (...my only reference point is tho, lmao). It felt much more like set in space. What drives forward is not its setting and all of the space travel, it's the political intrigue.
When Duke Leto Atreides gets the order from the Padisha Emperor Saddam IV to replace his cousin, the Baron Harkonnen, as ruler of the planet Arrakis (also known as DUNE), he knows that that's not a gift. The Emperor is intimidated by Leto's power and that he's held in high esteem by the other Higher Houses of the universe. And therefore Leto (along with the other Atreides) must be stopped. What then ensues is an exhilarating and complex net of plots which focuses on the all encompassing question of power. What makes a good ruler? Who is "allowed" to rule? What about the people who are ruled?

I didn't expect to be as psychological and philosophical as it was ... even though I heard it gets even more META throughout the rest of the series (CAN'T WAIT!). At the heart of the story, we follow Paul Atreides, son of Duke Leto, as he moves with his parents and their entourage from Caladan to Arrakis.




Paul was trained throughout his young life (he is 15 at the beginning of the book) by his mother, Lady Jessica, in her Bene Gesserit ways. The Bene Gesserit are a pseudo-religious organization of all-women spies, nuns, scientists, and theologians who use genetic experimentation, galactic political interference, and religious engineering to further their own agenda of ascending the human race with the advent of their chosen one, the Kwisatz Haderach. Paul struggles with the burden his mother has chosen for him. He knows that there is no such thing as "the chosen one"; it's a farce, a manipulation ‚Äì and yet something he can't escape.

Not gonna lie, I had my problems with Herbert's writing throughout the first third of the book. I have never read something quite like it. I know lots of people had problems with the rich world building in because Herbert tends to throw hundreds of terms (unique to his world) around without any explanation for them in the text; but having seen the movie BEFOREHAND (something I would highly recommend) made it SUPER EASY for me to picture everything and follow along. No, the problem I had was the actual WRITING STYLE. At first, it felt really clunky and ... just weird? Like, not literary at all? I know I'm doing a piss poor job at explaining it but at first I felt like I was reading a weird fanfiction of the movie (LMAO).

But when I got used to the writing and accepted it for what it is, I got reeeeaally lost in the book. And was actually amazed at how MODERN??? the writing felt. Like, could've literally been written in the 21st century. The writing definitely didn't feel OLD, even though it felt WEIRD in some parts. :D

Anyways, I finished within three days (which is a feat for me ... the book is almost 700 pages long and I usually only read 50 pages a day). It was a true page turner, especially two-thirds into the book ‚Äì when we finally got to the part of the story that wasn't shown in the movie ‚Äì I was glued to the pages. I couldn't believe what was happening. All the twists and turns were just AMAZING. And the ending was puurrrfect. [I really like that can be read as a standalone ... especially since I don't feel like committing to a 6-book-series that isn't even finished and literally 20+ extra novels that Herbert's son wrote to broaden the universe.]

is not a book I'd recommend to just anyone. You must have an appetite for it. You must be willing to forgive its author a couple of things for full enjoyment (like the role of women in the story, and that there are very few female characters to begin with; or Herbert's homophobia which comes through in his portrayal of the Baron Harkonnen). If you can't do that, you won't have a fun time. But if you really WANT to go on this journey, then will hold many adventures and purse-clutching moments for you.

Epic and highly inventive, but not nearly as great as I remember it being. I think Herbert's writing really gets in the way of the story. He continuously tells the reader what each character is thinking through italicized internal dialogue. Sometimes uses the third person narration to do the same thing in a more elegant way. The problem is that he does both, often times for the same character in the same paragraph. It's super clunky, and took me out of the story every time.

Dune es el libro que ha marcado mi inicio de viaje en la CF. Abri√©ndome as√≠ las puertas a un g√©nero que ha conseguido toda mi atenci√≥n. Un viaje sin duda apasionante. Me ha hecho sentir como un ni√±o abriendo un regalo y descubriendo un nuevo camino como lector en la CF. Consigue lo que todo libro y autor puede aspirar, ser memorable en el tiempo y en la memoria del lector que lo disfrut√≥. No puedo ponerle menos de cinco estrellas a esta joya.

La importancia de Dune creo que a d√≠a de hoy es indiscutible. Se considera como el que sent√≥ las bases de la ciencia ficci√≥n moderna. Lo que Frank Herbert logr√≥ en su libro es sorprendente porque logr√≥ construir un mundo fascinante con una ambientaci√≥n muy detallada que logra sumergirte en el propio desierto de Arrakis. Pero es que no solo esto ya que la pol√≠tica, la econom√≠a, las luchas de poder, la religi√≥n, la ecolog√≠a, la supervivencia y las estrategias logra que no solo sean importantes en la trama sino que sean incorporados de manera muy eficiente a la historia. P√°gina tras p√°gina me fue demostrando la pasi√≥n que le puso a su obra y el derroche de imaginaci√≥n e ideas que ten√≠a en su mente. El libro se public√≥ en 1965 y fue rechazado previamente por muchas editoriales. Las cu√°les en ese momento y hoy, se deben arrepentir mucho xD.



Tenemos una historia atemporal que trata sobre en lo que se ha convertido y como vive el ser humano. Seguimos a unos personajes muy interesantes que cumplen diversos roles o en algunos casos, destinos. Tenemos un mont√≥n de intrigas, sociedades de estrategia ya sea militar, pol√≠tica o religiosa pero sobretodo trata sobre la supervivencia en el planeta, Arrakis. Donde la riqueza, la verdadera riqueza, se cuenta en la cantidad de agua que uno posee. Una historia sobre lo que conlleva crear un profeta. Una sociedad muy compleja y complicada en la que la tecnolog√≠a es algo importante, en algunos casos esencial para la vida. Un mundo muy detallado que se ve diferente pero al mismo tiempo similar al nuestro. Consigue que vivas lo que est√°n pasando los personajes y sus pensamientos. Su brillante ambientaci√≥n con todos sus paisajes se sienten con total vividez, es un deleite absoluto para la vista o mejor dicho como lectores, para la imaginaci√≥n. Consigue transportarte al desierto y las dunas de Arrakis.

Para mi este es el mayor logro del libro por parte de su autor, pasar las p√°ginas y sentir que est√°s ah√≠, imaginar todo lo que te rodea cada grano de arena, cada roca, los gusanos y lo que supone vivir ah√≠. La constante importancia que se le da al agua en las p√°ginas, tu propia mente la refleja d√°ndote y a mi me pas√≥, sed.



El planeta Arrakis me fascin√≥. Sus desiertos, sus dunas y sus gusanos. Un mundo que curiosamente a pesar de generar la substancia m√°s preciada del universo su bien m√°s preciado es el agua. Que se lo digan a sus habitantes, los indomables Fremen. Una sociedad cuya forma de vida los ha endurecido con curiosas pero l√≥gicas costumbres que se basan en la adoraci√≥n de un bien que escasea y es fundamental para la supervivencia, es su moneda, el agua. Un bien muy preciado, el agua es vida y aqu√≠ todavia mas debido a la escasez y la valoran por encima de todo.

Esto forma los pilares en los que componen a su sociedad por ejemplo; si lloraras a un muerto o escupes es considerado una se√±al de gran respeto para ellos, ya que significa perder agua corporal.

En Arrakis se utilizan destiltrajes, una compleja y brillante vestimenta que absorve cada gota de agua que sale del cuerpo y la convierte en agua potable para que el portador del destiltraje pueda volver a beberla. Uno podr√≠a decir asqueroso. Pero si vives en Arrakis lo necesitar√°s y agradecer√°s desesperadamente beber.



Tenemos un repertorio de personajes que muestran cierta profundidad. Complejos, bien construidos y perfilados. Pero sobretodo muy humanos, pues se mueven por el poder, la religi√≥n y sobretodo por la supervivencia. Lo que m√°s flojea para mi son los personajes secundarios. Si bien es cierto que no tienen el mismo peso que los principales s√≠ los he notado m√°s de adorno, les falta mostrar algo de complejidad y atracci√≥n al leer.

Principales como los que componen la casa Atreides, aquellos que luchan por ellos con lealtad hac√≠a su duque y algunos de los ind√≥mitos Fremen. Tenemos villanos, como principal yo dir√≠a el Bar√≥n Harkonen, enemigo de la casa Atreides y un maestro de las intrigas, consigue lo que se propone sin que nada se interponga y es un ser bastante despreciable.

Con estos personajes obtenemos unos di√°logos trabajados, cargados de grandes citas. Citas dignas de marcar.

Tenemos profec√≠as, peleas, armas, sociedades, gusanos de arena y tecnolog√≠a que a√∫n no siendo un lector experimentado en el g√©nero, yo creo que quiz√°s no conste de tantos elementos tecnol√≥gicos o t√©rminos como en otras obras de CF ya que me pareci√≥ m√°s una mezcla de espada/fantas√≠a/CF. Hay momentos con cierta epicidad, cargados de emoci√≥n, momentazos que consiguen representar la esencia de lo que es Dune y como lector me he quedado sorprendido. En la historia hay humanos con ciertas habilidades especiales.

Aunque yo dir√≠a que la inteligencia en especial con las estrategias es la mayor o la m√°s importante habilidad/arma que se da en el libro. Los personajes le aportan mucho a la trama y encajan en ella a la perfecci√≥n, captan el inter√©s del lector queriendo o incluso necesitando pasar las p√°ginas para saber lo que pasar√° a continuaci√≥n, las estrategias y decisiones que ejecutar√°n y el desenlace.



Como punto negativo para mi ha sido el final. Me dio la sensaci√≥n de que se precipitaba un poco, me hubiera gustado que tuviera m√°s p√°ginas porque algunos momentos del desenlace me parecieron un poco bruscos, pasan muchas cosas en el √∫ltimo momento. El desenlace es casi ambiguo, un medio abierto medio cerrado. Se dan respuestas y puedes quedarte ah√≠ y no continuar, pero tambi√©n queda alg√∫n interrogante. A√±adir que al inicio de cada cap√≠tulo hay peque√±os fragmentos que quiz√°s se comprendan mejor con una segunda lectura.

Dune es una joya que perdurar√° en el tiempo y en la mente de los lectores que lo hemos disfrutado. Ha marcado mi inicio en la CF y ahora contemplo con gratitud y una gran emoci√≥n lo que me espera en este g√©nero. Ahora me entraron ganas de mirar las pel√≠culas, la vieja y la nueva cuando se estrene.

I liked Dune. After taking a day to digest wtf I just read.

Now I can truly find meaning in my favorite Anakin Skywalker quote: ‚ÄúI don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating ‚Äî and it gets everywhere.‚Äù

Update March 2024: Just bumping this mini-review to say I'm pleased with Villeneuve's adaptation for how he handled my Dune favourites. Feyd-Rautha has been done justice at long last, the trauma from the cringe yellow-pants Sting is over, the honour of House Harkonnen has been restored.

_______________________________

The start is one of the slowest beginnings I've found, and the writing could be much better than the rather basic prose Herbert exhibits, but the storyline and the setting are quite good once one gets past the first "book" in the this first installment of the saga. I enjoyed the plot and the worldbuilding a bit more than the characters, though I did like the villains more too, and am left interested enough to want to eventually continue with the rest to see how the story of the Atreides family will pan out.

I know everyone is so SHOCKED, but I loved Dune. Actually, jokes aside, I loved it so much more than I thought I would. I've been putting off reading it for years - I was afraid that it was going to be too dated, too long, too dense, etc. I think I was also afraid I was not going to love it as much as I other people loved it, and if you've ever been underwhelmed by a cult favorite or a classic - you KNOW how much that just doesn't feel good. But even though my expectations were very high going into it, ended up surpassing them.

See, I actually finished the book three days ago, and I simply didn't want to mark it "read" because I was just letting it sit with me. You might say "Marianna, if you loved it so much, why did you take 2 months to read it?" This may sound silly, but this was the first book in a very long time I just didn't want to burn through. I wanted to enjoy the world, the characters, and the writing. I wanted to let myself stay in this universe instead of rushing through it. Yes, I know it's a whole series and there is more to it, but that's the feeling I had reading this novel.

It's absolutely a book I can see myself reading again, and getting a lot more out of it. It's also a book I can see myself trying to force on other people. There are things within it that resonated with me more than I ever expected. There are ideas and quotes that really stuck with me. But let's also not forget that this is an amazing story and setting - a beautiful mix of sci-fi and fantasy that I so rarely see done well, and a spin on the emergence of a hero. Initially, I didn't have plans to immediately continue the series, but now I'm thinking it will happen a lot sooner than I anticipated ))

P.S. As if I could have looked forward to the movie adaptation done by my favorite director more... But yea, now I REALLY can't wait to watch the film! Sadly, I doubt it will be released this year at all, considering everything that's going on. Thanks, 2020...

***



I still love it. Obviously.
Even more fun after watching the movie, somehow!

***



I love it more and more every time I read it, which is crazy because I 5/5 loved it the first time I read it. Truly a sci-fi masterpiece that has something new to teach me with every read-through. Forever addicted to this spice.

‚ÄúFear is the mind-killer.‚Äù

by now i‚Äôve made it known how much i loved the second movie, so i impulsively decided to read the book. i honestly don‚Äôt even know how to explain the story since there‚Äôs so many moving layers and characters within Dune, but i‚Äôll try my best lol. just know that i enjoyed this and have gained way more insight into the minor details and character manuevring that was left out in the movies.



Dune follows Paul Atreides, Duke of a noble family on the inhospitable planet of Arrakis. the main source of power comes in the form of Spice‚Äî a drug that can enhance consciousness while also extending lifespans. there‚Äôs multiple pov‚Äôs: Paul, his mother Jessica, the rival families the Harkonnens and Fenrings, along with the desert people called Fremen. they all have separate motives and act accordingly to their respective plans to gain power. there was so much i wasn‚Äôt aware of and the ending honestly pleasantly surprised me. i‚Äôm so curious to continue the books eventually and the world building was so expansive beyond what i was originally imagining.

Rating: 4* of five

UPDATE 23 November 2021: I saw the Villeneuve version. Very beige. Not a huge fan. Memo to Chalamet's people: Don't let anyone else cast him in a role where the reason he's there is his cheekbones. He's better than that.

5/18/2019 The 1984 film is free with Prime on Amazon. With a new version and including some serious firepower from Director Denis Villeneuve to Timothee Chalamet as Muad'dib the Kwisatz Haderach, it seemed like a good moment for a rewatch. It truly is a gorgeous film, but not so hot on the woke front. Surprise surprise surprise says my brain in its full Gomer Pyle mode.
2/15/17: I found this 2003 about the 1984 film on YouTube. I wasn't wrong. The film wasn't very good. Beautiful, yes; good, not so much.
***
I first read this novel in 1975. It seems impossible that it was over 40 years ago, but the math is inescapable and time inexorable. My teenaged brain was rewired by the read. I had a standard by which to judge all future SFnal reads, and it was a high one. I was transported into a future I was utterly convinced would be the the one I'd have descendants to live in. I suppose that could yet happen. I'm a lot less convinced now that the human race's future is that long. Age might bring wisdom, I wouldn't know about that, but it sure brought me a booster shot of cynicism.

The Orange Catholic Bible, the books of the Empress Irulan, they all seemed to me so real...the cry "never to forgive, never to forget" rings louder today than it did in 1975 because I've lived through so many iterations of it by now. Us people, we love the shit out of our vicious vengeful vendettas, don't we. Frank Herbert got that right as all hell.

Trouble is, ol' Frank wasn't any kind of a writer, was he? He had flashes of good phrasemaking, he had long stretches of competent prosemongering, and then there was the rest of the ninety jillion words in the novel. Serviceable is le mot juste. And TBH I feel pretty generous putting it that way.

But then came David Lynch. Oh dear, oh dear. I'm not a worshipper of Lynch's at the best of times. I thought was brummagem and boring; was portentous twaddle. So the Kool-Aid passed my seat, I fear. His 1984 adaptation of was downright laughable. I left the theater torn between gales of laughter and gusts of grief-stricken tears. Sting in that stupid winged underwear! KYLE MacLACHLAN as Paul Atreides!! Ludicrous, all of it, and the problems started with the butchery of so much of the novel that even the bones were scattered in no sensible pattern. Inevitable, really, as the runtime of the film was a paltry two hours and seventeen minutes. Imagine trying to wedge a 600-page magnum opus dense with world-building and replete with internal ironies and levels of meaning into the length of a good winter's nap. Didn't work so good.

SciFi Channel, gods please bless their collective hides, approved a mini-series written and directed by John Harrison in 2000. It was 4:17:07 in total. That was *almost* enough to do justice to the story. The result was infinitely superior to the Lynch version. It was a joy to watch for me, a forty-year-old cruelly wounded mess of a man, and felt like a balm to my fanboy memory of the novel. Perfect? No. Great? Yep!

Then I found it on YouTube (of course it's since been deleted) and thought I'd take a respite from reality by giving it a rewatch.

You know what? Special effects age badly. Mid-budget TV ones age really, really, really badly. The screenplay clunked a good deal. The story, however, was all there and was well done, with the prunings and bonsai sculptings well chosen and well shaped. And the story was just about as timely as anything I could've hoped to avoid!

bashed me upside the temples with its portrayal of the collapse of Empire and revolution of the have-nots in a way it couldn't have 17 or 42 years ago. It felt more timely, it packed more wallop than it possibly could have in fatter times. This is my idea of good myth-making: A story that isn't finished telling us the truth yet, and doing so in a way that compels, impels, propels us to go on the journey ready or not. The idea of a Savior come to rescue us is eternally appealing, the sight of the unworthy getting their comeuppance is evergreen. It wasn't what I was seeking, wasn't escapist boom-bang-blowwie, but it was what I needed. A bit of heartening to fight again, odds be buggered.

And now I'm told that , possibly to be directed by Denis Villeneuve of fame. That's some fire-power there. A director with clout and access to Hollywood's cash box could do something special with this epic...though I'm still very concerned with the issues inevitable in adapting the story to movie length.

Isn't it interesting how every decade seems to call for a new version of the story? The 1960s had the novel; the 1970s the unmade adaptation, a perfect reflection of the decade's malaise/limitation mentality; the 1980s cheesy, overblown one-note-and-it's-the-wrong-one ethos; the 1990s void, again perfectly in keeping with the culture; the 2000s TV version, as everything shrunk in the aftermath of the floodwaters of Bush's election stealing; and now a big-budget, major-talent remake! That hasn't happened yet! And bids fair not to, in the parlous economic times ahead!

Frank Herbert's is a great rewatch. The novel hasn't finished with us yet. I hope it won't any time soon.

I'm probably going to make whoever reads this review angry, but oh well.

Whenever I ask anyone what sci-fi novels I should read, they always say "Have you read Dune?!"

And then their body is found two weeks later at the bottom of a lake.

This book . I don't usually come out and give such brutally negative reviews, but my god. If I ruled the world, I would ban this book for the sheer sake of how awful it is.

People say Tolkien's prose was a struggle to read through, but at least his style of writing was intentionally made to be fashioned after an Arthurian epic. Frank Herbert just writes like a... Hell, I dont even know what he writes like. You could put a million monkeys in front of a million typewriters and have them hammer keys until the end of time, and the monkey who wrote this would look at the abomination he had created and throw himself off a cliff. Frank Herbert didn't even have the shame to do that.

The pacing, the characters, the overall plotline, the miraculous events that seem to happen at , the awful dialogue, and the Mary Sue that is Paul Atreides simply boggles the mind.

I read this book because I thought there must be some redeeming quality somewhere at the end. Some glorious stroke of genius that somehow rescues the story from the fiery hell that is Frank H's staggeringly atrocious storytelling. But there wasn't. It ended, and that was several hours of my life I would never get back.

I exaggerated this review a lot more than was necessary for my own entertainment. But it's no lie that I had more fun writing this review than reading this book. -1/5.

Mostly riveting! In general, I think I loved it?

The worldbuilding is still legendary here, all these years later. I'm going to leave the issues alone (Obviously, there are issues. 1965 was a long time ago).

Mostly, I can see why this book is a beloved classic and why it's been so inspirational. It's a wild ride, interweaving a lot of cool threads, with so much to say about so many dimensions of human life in the possible future. Really cool overall. And the worms are awesome.

Video review is now up!

Read for my resolution to read classical sci-fi.

One of the classics of sci-fi and the best-selling sci-fi (in paperback), Dune is about the young Paul Atreides after his father Duke Leto is given control of the desert planet Arrakis by the emperor. However, there is a traitor plotting the downfall of the Atreides family and when the betrayal is finally enacted, Duke Leto dies and Paul and his Bene Gesserit mother, Lady Jessica, are thrown into the desert wildlands of the Fremen people. There, Paul learns about the spice, Arrakis' most covenanted product, the Fremen people and their prophecy of the one to come and save them.

But is Paul really a hero?

It took me quite a bit of time to read . It is a very complex novel with a lot of things going, characters with many motivations, and many warnings about hero worship and the way the environment has influence on people. Let's go ahead and focus on the elephant(s) in the room: the dialogue, the portrayal of women, and the colonialism thing.

The dialogue isn't as terrible as I thought it would be. Yes, there are some characters with weird dialogue like Piter, the Baron, Thufir Hawat, and Gurney Halleck. Everyone else was mostly fine; Lady Jessica was kind of a middle ground. The dialogue flowed a bit strange at times and the characters' mental reactions to certain statements often sounded like a computer talking. But other than that, fine.

The women of . Those who have not read are probably unaware that the story is partially narrated, or at least partially described, by Princess Irulan the daughter of the emperor and a Bene Gesserit. Irulan's excerpts reveal her omniscience, but also reveal how she knew Paul was not the hero everyone initially thought him to be. Lady Jessica I felt very conflicted about. She certainly could outsmart several people, especially men, as a result of her Bene Gesserit training. However, at times Lady Jessica seemed like the stereotypical overemotional motherly figure that has been featured in many stories, not just sci-fi. Jessica and Gurney have a debate on being emotional versus being very logical; an argument that readers will soon learn is not just on page. It feels kind of essentialist to make Jessica the emotional one and Gurney the logical one, that whole "women are emotional and men are logical" thing. At one point Jessica is so emotional that she fails to see that Dr. Yueh is the traitor just as he's about to tell her. On the other hand, Gurney gets so logical he fails to see how emotions play into humans' actions and decision. I don't think Jessica is the worst depiction, because she is very strong and smart, but still it feels stereotypical.

And Chani, Paul's Fremen lover. To be honest, Chani was just kind of there. She was certainly strong given her Fremen upbringing, but her impact on the story was not as much as I had been led to believe. She is certainly a motivational factor for Paul, but beyond that not much else.

Alia was probably the best female character. Innocent yet calculating in her thoughts and actions. I am so glad that Frank Herbert didn't kill her off in the final cut, though I wish we could see more of her.

The Bene Gesserit are an order of psychic witch-geneticist-nun-things who have trained many of the women in the empire. They have a breeding program to create the perfect male version, the Kwisatz Haderach--whom they believe Paul to be, or at least fit the myth of the Kwisatz Haderach into Paul--, and thus have become concubines for various male rulers, like Lady Jessica, in the empire to secure and purify the line. The Bene Gesserit are responsible for many things and events within , including the desiring of the spice drug and initially planting the religion among the Fremen to control them. An all-female organization with malefic intentions was not too common back when Herbert wrote this book. The Bene Gesserit are not the primal antagonists of ; interestingly enough, that right goes to power-hungry and corrupted men like the Baron and his nephews and the emperor. However, the fact that the Bene Gesserit are responsible for some many things and are all women makes me question the reasons. At no point in the story are women outright described as being inherently villainous, but why the Bene Gesserit like that? Who knows?

As for the colonialism aspects of the story, is actually pretty self-aware of this at times. It's clear that the empire and the Baron do not treat either the Fremen nor the planet well and the Fremen have every right to hate them. The book does not shy away from the Bene Gesserit's religious manipulation of the Fremen, even. One of the most important scenes in the book is Liet-Kynes' death. Before he dies, Liet-Kynes has a hallucination of his father who warns him that his support for turning Paul into a hero is one of the worse things he could've done for the Fremen and that Arrakis' environment influences people way more than they expect. A hero from the colonizers/settlers/offworlders--whatever you want to call them--cannot be a true hero for the natives of the planet, he will only doom them. However, also at times enacts the "noble savage" archetype. The Fremen are strong and courageous, but are ultimately wildlings with a regressive and superstitious society. So close, yet so far.

Okay, anyway, an actual review.

is actually one of the most poignant descents into villainy--tyranny?--I have ever read. The whole book is a warning about hero worship. Paul Atreides goes from being an inexperienced duke's son to Usul Muad'Dib, the messianic figure of the Fremen religion. According to his mother, he actually wasn't supposed to embody the religious aspects of the hero, and yet he does. Paul is literally a contradiction to every single other character's ideals and goals. He shows how logic and emotion and coexist in someone (Jessica and Gurney), how eliminating those you have deemed as failed is actually weakening yourself (the Baron), and how the religious superstitions you plant might have truth (Jessica and the Bene Gesserit), and how status of birth and breeding guarantees no certainty (again the Bene Gesserit).

Back to the environment thing. Arrakis' rigid environment has influenced everyone and everything who has touched it. The necessity of the spice, the prominence and strength of the Fremen religion, the political arrangements--everything! This went hand in hand with Paul's rise to power. The emperor and the Baron thought they knew or could control Arrakis and cause the downfall of Atreides, but instead their misunderstanding and pride only caused the birth of a (anti-)hero. Arrakis will deal with Paul later, I'm sure. But on its own.

Paul's rise was subversive. I went from expecting to fearful in such a subtle and gradual way. isn't perfect. But I'll be damned if it isn't significate.

So this is one of the greatest sci-fi books of all time huh interesting



I read the first 5 chapters of Dune (didn't understand shit), went to watch Dune in the cinema and then read the rest of the book and I have to say thank god for the movie. The movie made the world of Dune so much more tangible & digestable. The book throws you right into the lion's den with all these characters, places & terminology coupled with the flower writing style of Frank Herbert made it hard to follow the story.

This is suppose to be a review for the book ,but I can't help but compare it to the movie adaption and for once I actually find the movie better. Paul, Lady Jessica, the Duke and most of House Atreidis were so much more likeable in the movie (maybe that's the Timoth√©e Chalamet effect üòå), whereas I couldn't care less about them in the book. Only my man Duncan Idaho stays superior in both book and movie. As for the villains: Baron Vladimir Harkonnen was gross in every possible scenario and that didn't change no matter the medium. That vile energy transcends everything üíÄ

The way to consume this book is with the audiobook since it comes with full cast + sounds effect and is pretty good. Only because of the audiobook I can round up to 3 stars. It was very difficult to get into it otherwise.

The following is just me wanting to insert more Timoth√©e Chalamet and Zendaya gifs for ‚ú® the aesthetic ‚ú®











And lastly, a gif of me running away from all the Dune stans, because all I'm saying is that I think the movie is better than the book. Ok bye. üòá

I can't explain what attracted me to Dune--the 1965 science fiction epic by Frank Herbert, winner of the first Nebula Award and (in a tie, with This Immortal by Roger Zelazny) the Hugo Award--any better than T.E. Lawrence could explain what attracted him to the Arabian Peninsula. The book's prestige among genre fans was a factor, as were admissions by many that they read it in junior high school and found Herbert accessible. As inclined as I am towards local coffeeshops, perhaps Herbert's head space while writing the novel in Santa Rosa, California from 1959-1965 appealed to me most. I could almost smell the incense burning.



The galactic intrigue begins in the year 10,191 with excerpts from writings by the Princess Irulan, daughter of the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV and a holder of literary pretensions. The princess offers some perspective at the beginning of each chapter, hipping the reader to what's happening behind the scenes. We're introduced to Paul Atreides, the 15-year-old heir of Duke Leto Atredies, a charismatic planetary governor of Caladan whose popularity among the noble houses of the universe has garnered the attention, and jealously, of the emperor. Setting a trap, he offers Leto the planet of Arrakis, the most valuable real estate in the universe.

Arrakis is inhospitable to all but titanic-sized sandworms and a fierce tribe of desert dwellers known as the Fremen, but produces the priceless spice melange. In a future where mankind no longer relies on computers, the spice is a transformative agent that expands consciousness: empowering the navigators of the Spacing Guild who travel through space, the savvy Mentats who advise heads of state and the bewitching Reverend Mothers of the Bene Gesserit sect who see the future. Leaving their ancestral home on the verdant Caladan for Arrakis with Paul is his mother, the Lady Jessica, the duke's concubine and a Bene Gesserit, who is a black sheep among the Reverend Mothers.

place-between, -- FROM "MUAD'DIB, FAMILY COMMENTARIES" BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN

On moving day, Paul is visited by the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, Jessica's teacher, for a rite of passage and a test. The old crone confronts Jessica, who defied the Bene Gesserit order that she bear a daughter the sect intended to marry off to Feyd-Rautha, heir to the House Harkonnen, the industrious enemies of House Atredies. The Bene Gesserit believed the progeny of such a pairing would have produced the Kwisatz Haderach, a male with the power to see through space and time as they do. Jessica opted to bear Duke Leto the boy he wanted instead. The Reverend Mother sees some potential in Paul, but offers no hope his father will live to an old age.

Paul's education is overseen by his father's advisors--Thufir Hawat (a Mentat), the troubadour-warrior Gurney Halleck, the swordmaster Duncan Idaho and Dr. Wellington Yueh--but mostly by the Lady Jessica, who has trained her son in Bene Gesserit meditative techniques. Arriving in the garrison town of Arrakeen, Jessica encounters a housekeeper named the Shadout Mapes who is full of Fremen superstitions, intrigued as to whether Jessica may be the One, mother to the messiah who their prophecy holds will lead their people out of slavery. After Paul saves the housekeeper's life from a Harkonnen booby trap intended for him, she confides to the boy that there is a traitor among them.

Duke Leto forges an alliance with the Fremen, using imperial planetolgist Liet Kynes--who's gone native on Arrakis--as a liaison. Operating with the blessing of the Emperor and the assistance of his Sardaukur troops, the gluttonous Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and his Mentat, Piter De Vries, attack Arrakeen after the traitor in the House Atredies lowers the garrison's shields for them. The Baron exiles the Lady Jessica and Paul so he can claim plausible deniability in their deaths, but mother and son find refuge with the Fremen, with the tribe's revered leader Stilgar and Kynes' daughter, Chani. Paul learns of the prophecy of Muad'Dib, the desert mouse, who the Fremen hold as their messiah.

-- FROM "ARRAKIS AWAKENING" BY THE PRINCESS IRULAN

held me for over 616 of the paperback's 794 pages (appendixes, a map and an afterword by Brian Hebert stretch this edition to 883 pages) and in spite of its headlong dive into anticlimax, distilling the novel's pleasures have reminded me of what a fantastic trip it is. What separates from the work of most of Herbert's peers is the finesse of its prose and the depth of its characters as well as its ideas, which in a novel of this size, are plenty. Rather than write a novel in six sleepless nights as many before and since have done in this genre, Herbert took six years to research and write his science fiction, and the quality control shows.

Names like "Beast" Rabban or Count Hasimir Fenrig materialized to form clear images of Herbert's characters in my mind, and I liked how each of them--whether noble, assassin or servant--served their institutions and played their part in this galactic intrigue to their end. No one in remains static; there is work to be done or movement to be had at all times. The novel is like a chess game and the faster it plunged toward its climax, these characters did begin to resemble game tokens instead of humans. Herbert also writes entrances much better than he does exits--a symptom of book one in a series, perhaps--but envisions a wealth of roles for women in his universe.

is science fiction and if you're in the market for having your imagination stretched, you came to the right place. I found Herbert's ideas to be vastly compelling, many of them explored in detail and at length with fluid prose, as if the author were an anthropologist reporting back on a real universe: A future where expanded consciousness is more powerful than any machine. A matriarchal religious sect steering the genetic future of mankind. A consciousness expanding spice exploited as a commodity. A planet so arid that special suits are required to retain the body's moisture and tears are a phenomenon. There's even song verse!





















Why does my son sing a love song to that girl-child? Why did he choose that song?The instincts are true sometimes. Why did he do this?

After several abandoned attempts to adapt to film, particularly in the wake of , a big screen version produced by Raffaella De Laurentiis and written and directed by David Lynch opened in December 1984. Notable today for being the first big budget motion picture produced by a woman (with a production price tag of $40 million) and a rare studio assignment from the visionary who'd give the world and , the film was a commercial disappointment and was nearly universally panned by critics, but has resurfaced as a cult movie.

Shot in Mexico, the eclectic cast featured Kyle MacLachlan as Paul, Francesca Annis as Jessica, J√ºrgen Prochnow as Duke Leto, Freddie Jones as Thufir Hawat, Patrick Stewart as Gurney Halleck, Richard Jordan as Duncan Idaho, Dean Stockwell as Yueh, Kenneth McMillan as Baron Harkonnen, Brad Dourif as Piter De Vries, Sting as Feyd-Rautha, Linda Hunt as Shadout Mapes, Max Von Sydow as Dr. Kynes, Everett McGill as Stilgar, Sean Young as Chani and Virginia Madsen as Princess Irulan. Herbert's ideas are evocatively translated, but Lynch's commitment to imagery over story is an acquired taste.

Buddy re-read with Athena!

‚ÄúTo begin your study of the life of Muad'Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Muad'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place.‚Äù

Thus begins one of the greatest novels ever written.

About ten years ago, when I was ten or eleven years old, I took my first cautious steps away from children‚Äôs and young adult books and into the wonderful world of adult literature. I remember that there were especially two grand works of fiction that shaped this period of my life, and eventually managed to change it forever. The first was a huge brick of a fantasy novel whose name was . The second was a rather small, blue book with a particularly interesting cover, which I discovered in one of my father‚Äôs bookshelves. Its name was .

And that was how I first came along on the adventures of Paul-Muad‚ÄôDib on the endless sands of Arrakis. I met people like the warmaster Gurney Halleck and the swordmaster Duncan Idaho, the aging assassin Thufir Hawat, the wise and powerful Lady Jessica of the Bene Gesserit, the disgustingly evil Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, and the stunningly beautiful Princess Irulan. I encountered the greatest of the sandworms in the deep desert, and I witnessed Muad‚ÄôDib as he lived amongst the mysterious blue-eyed Fremen and as he struggled and fought against those who betrayed his family.

Now, ten years later, I have read the book once more. And to my great satisfaction I discovered that it had lost none of the magic that worked so well on me the first time. The political machinations of the Great Houses and the Imperium were still as interesting and exciting as the first time. The sandworms were still as awe-inspiring as when I last read about them. And even though the book could not possibly have the same effect on me today as it had on that little boy ten years ago, it was still an amazingly enjoyable book from the first page until the very end. There was more than a fair bit of nostalgia involved when it came to settling on a final rating, and I find it likely that the rating would have been lower if I were reading this for the first time. Still, I would argue that is not only one of my personal favourites, but one of the absolute best examples of fictional literature ever. It has become a pillar on which dozens of later works now stand, from to the .

What is it that makes this book so great? My answer would be neither the story nor the characters, even though both of those are great. No, the most extraordinary aspect about this book is most certainly its setting. In contrast to a great majority of science fiction, this novel takes place almost exclusively on one single planet. This is the world that inspired Tatooine. This is the world on which House Atreides fights for its survival in the heart of a treacherous universe. And, last but not least, this is the world where the sandworms roam. The world of the .

History will remember us as wives

2021 update: Reading this at 16, at the age of Paul Atreides, was a brilliant book. Reading this at 23, is all about relating to Jessica. This has aged like fine wine and I cannot wait for the movie.

What a book. The science fiction version of Lord of the Rings, but with the politics and intrigue of Game of Thrones. I'll have to reread it again sometime.

Edit: It's 2021, the world is in flames. There is no better time to read this book. Fear is the mind killer. There's not much to say that hasn't been said about this book - masterful, artful, anthropological, ecological before its time; a character study, fleshed-out female characters and a story that will be remembered as Muad'Dib was.

P.S. Also Denis Villeneuve is going to knock this one out of the park. Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 are two of my favourite films of all time - I see no reason that Dune won't be among them.

Verging on being one of those modern science fiction that could be considered a modern classic. It was penned in the 1960s and became a bestseller as well as a Hugo and Nebula award winner. Arthur C. Clarke drew comparisons with The Lord of the Rings for this book's impact and status in its genre. Herbert creates a world, a universe, cultures, history, and legends. Awesome reality building. 7 out of 12.

I feel like I'm throwing myself to the sharks here, but my thoughts on this book are so conflicting.

Is it about white-saviorism or is it a critique of white-saviorism? Who knows?
And this surely has some very badass female characters but can we also talk about how disturbing the idea of that order of nuns - the bene gesserit, is? And the almost complete absence of reproductive rights had me squirming. It's also fascinating how certain gender roles from Herbert's time are preserved even within the story.

I'm so tired of the 'history is cyclical, you cannot completely alter the future even with enough foreknowledge' trope in sci-fi, but I guees Herbert was amongst the first to use it and that must be lauded.

One of my Goodreads friends, Jan-Maat, told me about historian Daniel Immerwahr's analysis of the Dune series and I'm so into it.

Dune is predominantly about ecology and preservation of indigenous culture. It's about the seizure of native lands and the dispossession it causes. In the first book the protagonist Paul Atreides 'goes native' and joins the indigenous fremen in their revolt against the galactic empire after his family is betrayed. He takes a fremen name, learns their culture, takes a fremen 'concubine' and turns into a messiah figure (this is where the debate about white saviorism plays in.) Herbert himself was very sympathetic towards indigenous communities and rallied for their causes, but he was also a libertarian, far-right political writer. Immerwahr tries to show that this unresolved conflict between Herbert's two opposing political commitments shows up in the power dynamics and political differentials within the series. And I must say, I agree.

'Spice' has been interpreted as a psychedelic drug and there are clear middle-Eastern influences in the writing of fremen culture (although Herbert had a very surface understanding of middle-Eastern culture and politics, and never went deep into it.) The far-right on the other hand, has been very intolerant of drugs, the middle East, climate change, ecological preservation and indigenous populations. This difference in Herbert's ideologies is so clearly discernible in Paul's shifting roles between hero and villain.

The book is also about counter culture and interestingly, we have seen a rise of right wing counter culture recently and a renewed interest in the Dune series. Coincidence? I don't think so.

‚ÄúI must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.‚Äù

Dune is yet another book that I wouldn‚Äôt have picked up if it wasn‚Äôt for bookstagram. It always seemed too intimidating, too complex... maybe even a snooze-fest? Basically, it wasn‚Äôt for me. How wrong I was!

Dune is set on the desert planet Arrakis, where water is precious and the only thing of value is the ‚Äúspice‚Äù melange. Paul Atreides is the heir to a noble family tasked with ruling this inhospitable planet. That is, until, the Atreides family is betrayed...

While writing this review and thinking about the journey that was reading Dune, I am overwhelmed with the NEED to continue on with the series. The world-building is fucking incredible, the characters are complex and captivating, and the political feuds are so intricate and gripping. Oh, and the pi√®ce de r√©sistance, those sandworms. Dune is a triumph!

Whilst the depiction of women is somewhat problematic in the Dune universe, I found myself most intrigued by the female characters. From Lady Jessica herself, Paul‚Äôs powerful and fearsome mother, to Alia, the most fucking badass toddler to ever exist in fiction possibly. I appreciate that although Paul is ‚ÄúThe Chosen One‚Äù, he is still complex and flawed, and I don‚Äôt find myself actually liking him that much? Yet I still want to know more. I weirdly enjoyed the Harkonnen scenes the most, the most vile and villainous of villains that ever did exist.

I‚Äôm a little in awe of what Herbert was able to achieve - there‚Äôs just SO MUCH going on, yet all of the different themes and concepts are given equal weight. It‚Äôs literally impossible to break down everything I want to fangirl over and comment on in one single IG caption.

In summary, do not be intimidated by Dune. Let the spice flow. 4.5 stars.

Holy Shai-hulud! It was definitely time for me to finally read this truly great classic of science fiction!

I must say that I've watched the two mini-series, Dune and Children of Dune, in my teenage years. Thus, I already had a grasp of the story, what it was about.
However, nothing could have prepared me for the great writing style, the dense philosophy, ecology, and mythology of this story. It takes the term "world-building" to a whole new level.

So what is this about?
Well, that is not easily answered, but put very simply it is a book about a galactic empire and intrigue among the aristocratic houses within it. At the heart of the tale are the Emperor, the House Atreidis, and the House Harkonnen.
An assassination sets into motion a very old prophecy and the uprising of a people that has been suppressed for generations.
It's also about a planet that is merely a "factory" for melange (spice) and about the delicate balance of nature even in the most desolate of places.

Now, considering where I live and current events here, I must admit that reading all the Muslim names and terms, but especially reading about Jihad, made me EXTREMELY uncomfortable. The Fremen, the natives of the planet Arrakis (the afore-mentioned "factory" for spice), are fanatically religious and (almost happily) willing to commit genocide. This should have really turned me off. However, the story has enough "westerness" on one hand (the way the aristocracy as well as certain story elements are portrayed) and Paul on the other to make up for it (Paul, despite being the prophesied saviour, does everything he can to prevent genocide and actually tries to reign in the people worshipping him). I liked the burden Paul carries and that he realizes it really is a burden (death) and was therefore torn between using his powers and knowing their limits, being chivalrous and ruthless at the same time.

One of the greatest joys while reading this book (apart from the art of my edition which I shared with all of you through my status updates) was the ecology of the story. It was made clear in the introduction already, but even without that comment it would have been more than clear that Frank Herbert had the utmost respect for scientists and their work. One of the most impressive characters (Kynes) was a planetologist after all. It helps tremendously to bring this planet to life and make the reader trod from dune to cavern to city to any other place in this story. One feels the heat, the sand, the dryness of the place, and marvels just as much as any person within the story whenever there is a tiny bit of green presented or when a worm attacks.

But I also enjoy the Bene Gesserit. Their plans are certainly ... ambiguous at best. Genetic perfection. But also the plan to combine all houses and therefore create a certain equilibrium (and exert control). It's cold logic and I'm strongly opposed to forced matches or "breeding" of humans in general, but one cannot help but wonder if events hadn't been more peaceful if everyone had played his/her part as planned.

There is also a lot of heartbreak - both on the small and large scale.
For example, I cannot stop thinking about the slave trade and how some people are treated by basically everyone here.
Or like Irulan. In the book, Irulan has such a little active role, appearing just briefly at the very end of the tale but shining in that moment through her brave selflessnesss. Other than that, we only have quotes from various writings of hers about Muad'Dib and yet I felt so much pity for her. Sure, she lives the life of a princess with all its comforts (as opposed to the slaves or poor people of Arrakis) but although Paul is never cruel, he also doesn't love her (Irulan is just his key to the throne) and a loveless life is cruel enough in and of itself.
Then again, there is Chani, having Paul's love but never going to have the chance to call herself his wife (another form of sacrifice, to say nothing of
).

Every detail in this epic story has its place and though the novel is more about a wide sweep of events instead of deep characterization, every person is unique and delightful in their own way (be it vile Baron Harkonnen - no, I don't have a problem with the main villain being gay - , weird little badass Alia, powerful but also kind of lost Paul, underestimated Fenring and his wife, or any one of the "background characters") and there is development (mostly for Paul of course).

I cannot rave enough about this book, will watch the David Lynch movie tomorrow (since I haven't seen it yet), re-watch the mini-series for comparison and old times' sake, and (at some point in time) definitely re-read the book.

Dune is one of those reads that just feels so, so iconic when you read it. There is a certain gravitas to the writing that makes you feel like you are about experience a truly unique reading journey.

My brother very kindly gifted me with a special edition of Dune, so I was very lucky to be accompanied by some absolutely fantastic illustrations as I read this.



Dune is a book that after reading and thinking on it a while I admire so much. It has had such a huge role on science fiction since its release, and is a truly epic tale that encapsulates so much life and vividness in the pages. Whilst I did not adore the read, it is one that I still thoroughly enjoyed, and would most definitely read again in the future.

The world is of course one of the strong points. We are taken to a place that has living, thriving politics, with a rich history that makes the story feel very real. I thoroughly enjoyed how Frank Herbert included the reader in the mechanisms that would run a planet such as this, and shows how every decision influences the future of our characters.

For me the characters were a mixed bag. Those such as Duncan Idaho were compelling, with fleshed out motivations and some truly epic moments. The villains were similarly fantastic. The Baron was terrifying, and Frank Herbert did a great job making sure he did not full into the archetype, and in doing so crafted such an entertaining character.



Sadly, I did not click as much with Paul and Jessica, two of the main characters. They were solid, but as leading roles I felt they did lack something for me. It was by no means a negative to the story, but for me it really held it back from reaching those higher levels, despite the success of everything across the other spheres.

Dune is most certainly a unique and extraordinary book in many ways, and I can see how this has shaped an entire genre and dictated how it has evolved in so many ways. Not many books can claim to have had such an impact. And I think Dune deserves that. Whilst everything did not click with me, most of it did, and there were so many awesome ideas and concepts that Frank Herbert explored so well. A great mix of characters, with a certainly epic story, and an engaging plot that rides on the revenge story that we love so much.

I don't need to write a full review of this because it's Dune; literally what else can I say about it that hasn't already been said?

What I can say is that as someone who doesn't read a lot of sci-fi/high fantasy, I found this a lot easier to read than I expected! Particularly because I watched the 2021 film (Part One) before reading this so I had a visual reference as well as general understanding of the various factions/politics at play which really helped. As well as the terminology and concepts the book explores.

That made the first 55% or so of the book fly by as more of a 'refresher' since the movie pretty faithfully adapts that portion of the story. Of course in the book you get a bit more detail and character depth which I loved.

I'm a sucker for themes of politics and religion, fate and humanity (animals vs humans), and more that was explored through this exciting and fast-paced story. The dialogue was great. I loved the epigraphs at the start of each chapter. All in all, I am shocked but happy with how much I loved this!

Does the world need another Dune review? I very much doubt it needs mine but that never stopped me before, saturation be damned!

Dune in and of itself, in isolation from the rest of the numerous other Dune books, is by general consensus the greatest sci-fi novel of all time. You may not agree, and one book can not please everybody but statistically Dune comes closest to achieving just this. Witness how often you see it at or near the top of all-time best sf books lists.

I never read Dune with the intent to reviewing it before, it makes for a more attentive and actually more enjoyable reading experience. When I first read it in my early teens I did not really appreciate it, I thought it was good but overrated. There are just too much depth for my young mind to handle. I got the gist of the story just fine but the of the novel completely escaped me.

What makes Dune superior to most sf books is the quality of the world building. Frank Herbert went into painstaking details of Arrakis without ever bogging down the story. During the main body of the novel (excluding the appendices) he did not once resort to making info dumps. How many modern day sf authors can do that? Still, world building alone can not possibly account for the legendary status of the book. Herbert places equal emphasis on the characterization, plot and prose. The book is full of memorable characters from the badass Lady Jessica, to Paul Atreides who starts off as a fairly generic Luke Skywalkerish ‚Äúchosen one‚Äù kid to a messianic figure always ready with a sage comment for every occasion. The villains are even more colorful, especially the super-sized Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, so fat he needs anti gravity devices to help support his girth (cue worthless yo papa so fat he needs suspensors jokes). And his psychotic nephew Feyd-Rautha who is a ruthless natural born killer and seems kind of gay for some reason.

When I read it as a young lad the book seemed very long, but by today‚Äôs gigantic epic sf/f books standard Dune‚Äôs 896 pages length does not seems like much of a challenge if you take into account almost 100 pages of appendices and glossary. It is a highly readable and accessible book that transports the reader to a very vividly realized place. If you are looking for a bit of escapism you can not beat reading Dune for the first time.

‚Äúthere is no escape ‚Äî we pay for the violence of our ancestors.‚Äù

a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away‚Ä¶

dune is widely regarded as the progenitor of the (modern) sci-fi genre. mixing the political intrigue of feudalism with philosophy, environmentalism, and a classic hero‚Äôs journey, the story centers on the atreides family as they journey to one of the most fought-over planets in the galaxy: .

this desert planet is in every meaning of the word: in its harsh climate and dangerous fauna, its native population of tough-as-nails , and in the presence of atreides‚Äô rival house . all are factors that pose a risk to atreides‚Äô control of the planet.

thanks to an omniscient narrator, we‚Äôre keenly aware of any character‚Äôs thoughts and motivations throughout the story. our main protagonists, however, are undoubtedly , a 15-year-old boy rumored to be a child of prophecy, and , paul‚Äôs mother, a powerful leader with superhuman abilities that she‚Äôs also taught to her son.

a lot of elements of this story will feel like . we witness paul‚Äôs growth from boy to man as he accepts the mantle of leadership, and passes several . not only his family and his father‚Äôs trusted lieutenants act as his teachers, but so does the planet itself. we know he‚Äôs gotta stumble and fall before he can take his rightful place as his father‚Äôs heir.

however, i was very pleasantly surprised by in the that herbert weaves into the story: profit versus environmentalism (see also: a metaphor for oil) with a side-serving of ecology and terraforming, the possibly violent combination of mysticism/religion and politics, and the level of manipulation that‚Äôs often required to move about in a rigid world like that of .

it‚Äôs a constant , though, which i thought permeated every single aspect of the story. one or two things are really, cool and then whatever accompanies those things is decidedly cool.

let‚Äôs take . where paul and jessica feel like very complete, flawed, and complex characters, a lot of the others are like‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not even cardboard. hot air, then? i mean, we have a fat, gay, pedophile antagonist, for god‚Äôs sake. and paul‚Äôs love interest is just for only that.

same goes for : the way the culture is fully based on the preservation of water, working its way into language and customs and misunderstandings, is amazingly immersive. but then the rest of their ways are just a very obvious, butchered rip-off of a westernized perception of the imazigen, the indigenous people of north africa (with some buddhist-esque sayings thrown in).

then there‚Äôs of the galaxy‚Äôs feudalist society: we see lady jessica defy them and play around them in a myriad of clever, powerful ways that establish her agency and her ability to function any sexist female archetypes. sure, she might‚Äôve birthed a messianic figure, but she‚Äôs a smart political advisor and she can whoop any warrior‚Äôs ass because she‚Äôs a superb fighter, too.

and yet in the story are either (1) background fodder, (2) making babies, (3) thinking about making babies so bloodlines can be manipulated in a very creepy eugenics way, or (4) servant, concubine, wife or pleasure slave.

meanwhile, paul is out there defying the rigid view (and conflation) of sex and gender to a point where the subtext argues he‚Äôs neither man nor woman, but the other characters remain firmly entrenched in their subscribed roles (which is easy, here: man = battle, woman = birth).

and oh, , you were done dirty too. a hostile desert planet with something as amazing as ! and spice, the product that shapes galaxy-wide profit systems and changes the very fabric of the people consuming it. and yet the book never seems to move beyond Generic Sandy Places and has a complete lack of engaging descriptions.


see what i mean? it‚Äôs : in this book, you cannot have your cake and eat it, too. do you want to have a cool thing? sure, but you‚Äôll also have to accept a very uncool thing alongside it. so whether you‚Äôll enjoy this book probably depends on how well you can stomach the free bad stuff herbert is handing out alongside his interesting concepts.

but when it‚Äôs good, it‚Äôs Pretty Damn Good. of this book is off the charts. philosophically, there‚Äôs so many interesting discussions going on about identity, responsibility, revenge, defying existing systems. and unlike most reviewers out here, i actually loved -- which is great, because that‚Äôs about 80% of the book.

(the other 20% are cursory descriptions, prophetic visions, and terrible action scenes.)

the impact of this book cannot be denied. does it have problems? yes. myriads. the orientalism and white savior stuff probably being some of the worst offenders.

did i still have an unexpectedly good time reading it, which might have been tinted by my nostalgia glasses? yes.

i like tortured heroes and women who are so confident in themselves that they‚Äôre like, . i like it when bad guys get stabbed and when scientists have beautiful, romantic dreams about terraforming.

at the end of the day, this book is kinda like , but with more substance. or wait, is it the other way around -- and is like , but with less substance‚Ä¶? either way, both have more than enough sand.

3/28/19 audio reread I have no idea how many times I‚Äôve read this book. The audio is one of my favorite go-tos. The full cast breathes life into the characters. I‚Äôd like to discuss the amazingly original plot, but it‚Äôs been years since I read the paper copy and can‚Äôt remember the spellings of most things.

I am so glad I finally fulfilled my half of the bet.

This book was so dumb it was a chore to get through it--and I haven‚Äôt pushed past the pain period in years. People riding worms, killing their grandpas, weird names for knives, bullets and don‚Äôt forget, everyone is addicted to Cinnamon. I thought it was lame. It felt really juvenile. The author seemed to be trying really hard to make everything really mysterious and mythical, and all I could think was how lame it was: all-blue eyes, a worms called a "makers," suits where you drink your own body moisture (disgusting).

I'm also annoyed that this book was read in exchange for Pride and Prejudice. Compared with a timeless classic the book seems like a 1st grade primer. Austen is a master of plot and suspense. You may not like the subject matter, admittedly it is a little girlie, but the woman can write. Herbert? Not even close.

"Dune" is full of great ideas, many of which have been copied by other sci-fi books and movies. The most notable copycat is Star Wars. As I read "Dune", I was amazed by how much of the story was directly lifted by the Star Wars movies.

Of course, "Dune" is much darker than Star Wars and more epic in scope. The world-building is very well done, and Frank Herbert does a brilliant job addressing the philosophical and practical implications of trusting the fate of a world to a single messiah-type figure. Do the ends justify the means? Herbert leaves this as an open question.

Why only four stars? I subtracted one star because of the clunky writing style, which is a barrier for fully enjoying this work. This may be sacrilege, but I think this is a case where collaborative writing would have improved the work. With Frank Herbert as the ideas guy paired with someone who is devoted solely to writing, I think "Dune" could have risen to even greater heights.

Is it space opera? Is it political commentary? Is it philosophical exploration? Is it fantasy? _Dune_ is all of these things and possibly more. One thing I do know: it's a kick-ass read!

I've loved this book since I first plunged into it's mightily constructed, weird and obscure world. Of course it's hailed as a classic, and I am one of those that agrees. The sheer magnitude of Herbert's invention, his monumental world-building tied with an exciting story of betrayal, survival, rebellion and ultimate ascendance are more than enough to guarantee that.

His characters too, are worthy of note: Paul Atreides the young heir to not only a ducal throne, but the hopes and desires of the oppressed population of an entire planet and the strange otherworldly powers of prescience and command that are his unique birthright; his mother Jessica torn between devotion to her family and her pledge to a generations-long plan spawned by a secret order bent on controlling the universe from behing the scenes; Chani and Stilgar the wild yet honourable representatives of a dangerous people just waiting to burst their chains and explode onto an unsuspecting universe. Add to these heroes the malign Baron Harkonnen and his debased nephews Feyd Rautha and "the beast" Rabban, the spiteful and covetous Emperor Shaddam IV, masterminds of the fall of Paul's House, and we have the recipe for an exciting contest of wills with no less than the future of humanity at stake.

Even without an exciting story to drive it, the book is almost worth reading just to experience the world created by Herbert. 10,000 years in the future mankind has experience the "Butlerian Jihad" wherein all "thinking machines" were destroyed and the hatred of the technological has a religious conviction. In their place there are the Mentats, the "human computers" able to utilize the human mind to nearly it's full potential, drawing accurate inferences and conclusions with minimal data. There is the Sisterhood of the Bene Gesserit, a community of women who have honed their mental powers to the point of a near magical ability to coerce, tied with a training in politics and influence that would make Machiavelli proud. Finally is the Guild: a community of mutated humans, the sole "pilots" able to bend space and foresee their path amidst the void and thus keep interstellar trade and community together.

Both the Siterhood and the Guild owe their great powers to the mysterious spice Melange, the only product of the planet Arrakis (known colloquially as Dune) and the society of the Empire in general also depends on it for its "geriatric qualities". Dune is thus the linch-pin for all Imperial power. Without the spice, travel ceases, trade stops, life ends. He who controls the spice controls the universe.

Upon this stage is born Paul Atreides, the son of the Duke who is to take control of Arrakis as a fiefdom for the emperor. Paul is not merely the heir to political power though, for he is the last link in a chain of breeding that has been going on for generations, part of a plan created by the Bene Gesserit in the hopes of breeding a superhuman whom they could control. But Paul was born too early, his mother's rebellion against her orders have brought about an unforeseen occurrence. Now in the midst of political betrayal and the loss of all he has known Paul must also fight for survival amongst the most merciless tribe of humanity the universe has formed. Greater powers than any human before him has known will be thrust upon the young man, and the mantle of messiah will be his to accept or reject.

Did I mention that I love this book? Well I do. I highly recommend it to any and all. I must admit that there is the occasional infelicity in some of Herbert's prose (and a too-heavy reliance on inner monologues to either state the obvious or convey information to the reader), but overall I can forgive him this for having crafted such an excellent tale. Woven into the story of a tottering space empire are real questions about ecology, responsibility and human life that are well-worth thinking about. Politics is not just a veneer, but the lifeblood of this story and, to me at least, it makes it all the more exciting.

I'll admit right here that I am one of the few who actually likes all of the original Dune books, though I must admit that after the original trilogy Herbert seems to lose some of the strands of his narrative thread and my admiration is mostly due to the character of
and the world-building. (But please avoid the prequels and sequels written by Herbert's son and Kevin Anderson in an attempt to cash in on the franchise, they are worse than anathema.)

"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear‚Äù

An epic Science Fiction canon, a true classic and one that everyone should read once. Fascinating, complex, imaginative and ground-breaking in many ways. So, did I love it? The answer is yes and no but first a short summary of the plot.



Dune is set on the desert planet Arrakis, one of the many planets in the empire, and run by a few aristocratic families mainly the House of Atreides and House Harkonnen who both seek to control its more precious resource. A powerful spice that is necessary for space travel, mindfulness, and is known to extend the life of those who use it.

Survival, treachery, greed, and betrayal are at every turn as Paul Atreides must, having succeeded his father as head of the family, now win the most significant battle of all. Control of the melange ‚Äì the spice. As he faces many in battle, he must also devise a method of mining the spice for use. However, despite the technology available he turns to the natural world of the planet Dune for his answer and must learn to control the worms. His new army of workers.



Although set in space it is a book that contains a lot of the key ingredients for an epic novel, Power, Politics, War, Religion, and love with copious amounts of greed, deception, betrayal with a fascinating array of characters. This part I loved, and the writing style is excellent even though it was too long in places.

The but is, I don‚Äôt particularly enjoy science fiction, and sometimes it was a bit too far fetched particularly the inclusion of worms to helped mine the spice. And whilst a lot of ideas have been taken and bettered in later sci-fi books and films, it is important to remember this book was written in the 1960‚Äôs and ground-breaking at the time. Yet despite being written a long time ago I was in awe of the wonderful imagination it took to write such a timeless classic.

I have rated ‚ÄòDune‚Äô in the context of the genre it was written for, the writing style, characters, plot, and overall enjoyment. A 3/4 and settled on a ‚Äò4‚Äô.

And Dune completes my reading challenge!!!

One of the world's most loved science-fiction novels of all time. There's probably not a lot that hasn't been said about this book. So, let's get straight to the elephant in the room. Why only three stars?

Honestly, it's a little hard for me to explain. Three stars means "I liked it". And I did, in fact, often find it intriguing. But except for the intricate world-building I can't really point to a tangible reason for that.

On the other hand there are several things I wasn't impressed with. From Princess Irulan spoiling several plot-developments at the beginning of chapters, the languishing pace and a lack of characters I cared about to average (dialogue) or below average (inner monologue) writing. Especially the last point was a little annoying. You really don't have to explain to me everything that has just happened by letting the characters think about it at length. Over and over and over. Actually, now that I think about it, that's pretty bad writing.

Surprisingly little sci-fi in this sci-fi classic as well. But that was more of a surprise than a disappointment.

If I had read this in another month, not one where I struggled badly reading anything, I might have appreciated a book that's so heavy on politics and religion maybe a little bit more. Maybe.

Sandworms are cool though. And the one passage that I added to my quotes is actually pretty awesome.

‚ÄúDeep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.‚Äù

My mind is a whirling mess as Lady Jessica's assurance to Chani echoes in my head. What an absolute glorious read in this vivid universe created by Frank Herbert my god that was something.

I am typing out a full review now and will hopefully post it soon

one of the primary points is how 3rd person omniscient pov was so essential to tell this tale. Knowing the character's history and motivations and future in a world where characters were also able to access that information was paramount to the text and created such a unique reading experience (since most modern books aren't written in omniscient). The tension was shifted because the questions raised were so much more macro.

‚ÄúDune‚Äù is probably my husband‚Äôs favorite book, and he was so happy that I decided to re-read it so that we could talk about it. We had just watched the absolutely stunning Denis Villeneuve movie (thoughts about that at the end of the review) and we were both geeking out pretty hard about it. It was a pleasure to re-immerse myself in Herbert‚Äôs world, and while my previous criticism of the book still holds, I found myself enjoying it so much more this time. Perhaps it is because books like ‚ÄúDune‚Äù, which are so complex and layered, really benefit for re-reading, as you notice things you might have glossed over before, and reconnect with interesting ideas and concepts you had enjoyed the first time around‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm very excited to add ‚ÄúDune Messiah‚Äù and ‚ÄúChildren of Dune‚Äù to my short term reading list, as I can‚Äôt wait to go back to Arrakis!

Original review:



My mother is a bonafide, vintage geek girl. I grew up watching ‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù with her and she used to read me Tolkein as bed-time stories. She had piles of Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke books all over the place. These days, she obsesses over ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù‚Ä¶ As you can guess, she also loves ‚ÄúDune‚Äù, and she was so excited when the 2000 series finally aired on the Space channel. That was my first exposure to Frank Herbert‚Äôs work and it took me a very long time to get around to reading the actual book.

At this point, I think everyone know this is a messianic story, with a pretty classic layout. A prophecy foretold the arrival of a warrior-leader on the desert planet of Arrakis, who would free it‚Äôs people and turn the planet into a paradise where no one would ever want for water again. In parallel, the Emperor gives control of the planet to House Atreide: it‚Äôs the most valuable planet in the universe, as it is the only source of the precious spice, necessary to space travel: but it is also a white elephant, as it is hostile and House Harkonnen, the devious former rulers, will stop at nothing to get it back. You can already see how that will unfold. The strength of this book is not in the element of surprise, it is in the mind-blowing world-building and characterization. The details of the social structure, history, customs, religion and politics in ‚ÄúDune‚Äù make it feel incredibly real as your turn the pages. Having seen the series before reading the book, I pictured everyone dressed in elaborate, geometrical costumes and headdresses; I saw monumental architecture with bright colours.

But what I loved the most about ‚ÄúDune‚Äù is that it is the deconstruction of a messiah. How does it feel to be the person legend has predicted for generations, anxiously anticipated by the oppressed, who will blindly follow you anywhere because they fanatically believe that you will save them? Knowing many will die to fulfil the prophecies and that this blood will ultimately be on your hand, seeing small events and knowing they will one day be told as grandiose moments that had very little to do with what actually happened. That can‚Äôt be a comfortable hat to wear and I felt for Paul. I also felt for Jessica, who watched her son transform into something she could have hardly imagined when she decided to disobey the orders of the Bene Gesserit and provide her lover with a son and heir instead of a daughter.

This brings me to how fascinated I was with the amount of control the Bene Gesserit held over the various legends and folk tales, with their Missionaria Protectiva and their breeding program. I wanted to know all about it, read their histories and plans! I think it a very successful world-building when I wish I could live in it and go to the local library to read about it!

That being said, the dryness of the writing was a bit of a turn-off. I was so annoyed every time Hebert felt the need to write ‚ÄúAahh‚Äù or ‚ÄúHum‚Äù mid-dialogue, to show me the person speaking was hesitating. I feel like he could have been more evocative without resorting to this weird addition to conversation. I could have also used more lush descriptions, to cement his world in my brain and make it even more alive. But these are really minor qualms: I really enjoyed this book, and I will be reading the sequels.

Thoughts about the 2021 movie:



I am a huge fan of Denis Villeneuve, and I was so excited when the news that he‚Äôd be directing a new adaptation of ‚ÄúDune‚Äù came out ‚Äì and he did not disappoint. The other versions are cool in their own rights, but they have a certain tackiness to their looks that made it hard for me to really buy into the illusion of the movies. This time, the absolute beauty of the photography, the masterful music and the gorgeous costumes and sets blew me away, and I must have muttered ‚ÄúThis is so fucking cool!‚Äù a dozen time. The casting is perfect, and I say that as someone who detests Chalamet ‚Äì I still kinda want to punch him, but the skinny bastard is so good‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so glad that the second movie is going to happen, because I want this to become the gold standard for sci-fi films.

1ra parte le√≠da hace muchos a√±os. Vuelto a leer hace algunos meses. Me bast√≥ solo con el primer libro. No fue nunca del tipo de ciencia ficci√≥n que me ha gustado. Esta vez se me haya hecho algo m√°s lenta y obsoleta su narrativa( mi opini√≥n).
Es verdad que toda la info. intr√≠nseca en sus historias y di√°logos hacen de esta obra una muy completa. Una novela y seguramente saga ( al que se la lea completa) que perdurar√°, y de las que se continuar√°n sirviendo muchos escritores de ciencia ficci√≥n como parte de luz inspiracional para crear sus propios mundos. Como lo ha sido tb de alguna manera en mi caso. No obstante, para mi gusto actual demasiado muy √©pica y obsoleta para con el sentido de la ciencia ficci√≥n y su tecnolog√≠a de nuestros tiempos.
La ciencia ficci√≥n no son solo naves voladoras, mundos conquistados o gusanos gigantes, tambien lo son sus di√°logos y los conocimientos tecnol√≥gicos actuales que en ellos se describan. Ojo, una muy buena obra!!! Es solo que no me entretuvo tanto en su reelectura a√±os despu√©s.Pero es solo mi opini√≥n!

‚ÄúNo more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the hands of a Hero‚Äù

Doooooooon.

She sensed it, the nerd consciousness that she could not escape. There was the sharpened clarity, the inflow of data, the cold precision of her awareness. She sank to the floor, sitting with her back against (gyp)rock, giving herself up to it. Awareness flowed into that timeless stratum where she could view time, sensing the available paths, the winds of the future‚Ä¶the winds of the past‚Ä¶

The one-eyed vision of the past, casting back to Lawrence of Arabia, further back to the story of Muhammad and all the hero‚Äôs journeys of antiquity. The one-eyed vision of the future, probing ahead to and and‚Ä¶ ? Yes, . The one-eyed vision of the present, gazing, uh, sideways at the peyote Frank Herbert was on, at 1960s psychedelia, obsessions with altered consciousness and Eastern religions. All these combined in a trinocular vision that permitted her to see time-become-space-become-blockbuster-movies.

she told herself.

This was the third or fourth time I've read this story and it was just as enjoyable as the very first time - if not even more so thanks to me now knowing the full mythology (almost) which gives further insight into the beginnings (hindsight is a nice thing).

We are in the far future, in a far-spread feudal galactic empire full of noble houses that control different planets. There is a navigators' guild who ensures space travel as well as the sisterhood of the Bene Gesserit, an order of female seers that also control bloodlines through clever and strategic influence.
The most important planet in this setting is Arrakis, also called Dune, where the mysterious drug "Melange" (aka "Spice") is made. This drug is necessary for the navigators to see where they are taking the ships to and for the sisterhood to foretell the future somewhat. Therefore, fiefdom of Arrakis is prestigious but also dangerous thanks to court intrigues. So far, House Harkonnen has controlled Arrakis but the emperor has now charged House Atreidis with the task.
Thus, young Paul Atreidis goes from his Earth-like place of birth to the desert planet with his father (Lord Leto Atreidis), his mother (Lady Jessica, NOT a noble but "merely" Lord Leto's concubine and a Bene Gesserit) as well as the entire household (war masters, teachers, and cooks alike). It's quite the culture shock for him there as even tears are alien to the native population because literally every drop of water is precious.
What is more, he might be the prophesized messiah - which at first comes in handy when almost the entire Atreidis family is slaughtered, but also brings immeasurably negative consequences in the end.
In between, we get a rich mythology full of giant worms, nomad-like people, intense battles and a whole lot more.

Even now, after I (and many others) know this story so well, I shall not reveal more as the discovery is what you should be here for. Immerse yourself in the hot sands and spice trances.

The reason I'm reading this again now (and only after I've finally read books 2-6 recently) is that I'll watch part I as filmed by Denis Villeneuve tomorrow. Moreover, I couldn't resist and got myself this stunning edition:









Yep, another edition on my shelf and I don't mind at all because Frank Herbert created the scifi equivalent of what Tolkien did with Middle-Earth. It's vast, it's fascinating, it's invigorating. And the writing sweeps you along, too. Great ecological, political and sociological topics are cleverly woven into a gripping space saga.

‚ÄúThe prayer of the salat has carved out our hiding place. Now ‚Ä¶ I must play the part of Auliya, the Friend of God‚Ä¶ Sayyadina to rogue peoples‚Ä¶‚Äù

ü•¥‚ÅâÔ∏è

A self-spoiling, mind-numbing sci-fi novel set 20,000 years in the future that takes heavily from Arab culture and the Islamic faith, Dune is little more than a contrived, appropriation nightmare that has received pronounced popularity of late due to the upcoming remake of the film.

Set in the year 10,191, teen Paul Atreides, his father Duke Leto and his witch-mother Jessica, travel from their prosperous oceanic home planet, Caladan, to the inhospitable desert planet Arrakis (Dune), after stewardship of Dune is transferred by the galactic Emperor from enemy Harkonnens, who have ruled Arrakis for 80 years, to the Atreides. Dune is home to the much sought-after drug, melange (‚Äúspice‚Äù), which confers psychic abilities upon the user and enables interstellar space travel. Spice, however, is heavily protected by Arrakis‚Äô deadly giant sandworms, thus is difficult to procure. The Harkonnens who control the planet and its spice are not quick to give up their rule. The Atreides therefore make a pact with the indigenous Zensunni desert dwellers of Arrakis‚Äîthe mysterious ‚ÄòFremen‚Äô ü•∑üèª‚Äîto overthrow the enemy Harkonnens and reclaim their right to Arrakis and its spice. This is no easy feat, however, and young Paul is suddenly thrust into the role of messianic saviour... ü™ê

From the derogatory, lazy mythologising of Arab culture and Islam (‚Äòworld-building‚Äô apparently) and the utter bastardisation of Arabic, there was very little I enjoyed about this book. Apparently sci-fi involves justifying the brazen appropriation and bastardisation of the language/culture of ‚Äòexotic‚Äô/‚Äôeastern‚Äô people (who are ‚Äòalien‚Äô and uncivilised) by flinging the narrative into the future and expecting the reader to be okay with it. In what world (no pun intended) is this accepted as world-building? You think Dune paved the way? Yeah, by showing its successors how NOT to write sci-fi. This was not only grossly unoriginal and embarrassing to read (don‚Äôt care that it was written in the 60s. Doesn‚Äôt excuse shameless appropriation) but also deeply insulting and disrespectful. Only the wholly ignorant, for whom anything other than their immediate vicinity is deemed irrelevant, would find Herbert‚Äôs futuristic world captivating. For the rest of us, it was simply distasteful and embarrassing.

He really spun a wheel to choose a random Arabic word and then spun another wheel to assign to it a random English meaning.

Yer a Taqwa, Harry‚Ä¶ ü™Ñ

There are SO many examples to give from this book but here are a few to make you laugh:
- Shari-a (part of a prophecy book regarding superstitious ritual)
- Auliya (God‚Äôs handmaiden, audhubillah lol),
- Lisan al-gaib (off-world prophet)
- Mahdi (self-explanatory!)
- Muad‚Äôdib (kangaroo mouse, also Paul lol!)
- Fedaykin (adapted from fedayeen)
- Hal yawm (‚Äònow‚Äô/‚Äôat last‚Äô)
- Jihad (religious crusade)
- Jubba cloak (‚Äònaan bread‚Äô energy‚Ä¶.)
- Sayyadina (female acolyte in the Fremen hierarchy)
- Zensunni ‚Äì Basically a blend of Zen Buddhism and Sunni Islam. They‚Äôre the followers of the sect that broke away from the teachings of MAOMETH‚Ä¶ or the ‚ÄòThird Muhammed‚Äô (?!).

‚ÄúIt was Ramadhan and April on Bela Tegeuse [‚Ä¶] there was a basket with mish mish and baklawa and mugs of liban‚Ä¶‚Äù At least he knew what baklawa was ig.

‚ÄúPaul recalled the words of 467 kalima in yueh‚Äôs O.C bible." He.. recalled.. the what now?

‚ÄúYa! Ya! Yawm! Ya! Ya! Yawm! Mu zein, wallah! Ya! Ya! Yawm! Mu zein, wallah!‚Äù LMFAOOO

It was also really annoying flitting between the main text and the glossary to remind yourself of what the heck he was on about.

One may argue that Herbert‚Äôs unrepentant hijacking of Arab culture, the Islamic faith, and other ‚Äòeastern‚Äô cultures does not necessarily portray Arabs/Muslims/PoC in a negative light ‚Äì one, because it is set tens of thousands of years in the future and all these religions/cultures have essentially ‚Äòmerged‚Äô so the misuse and appropriation of words matter little, and two, it cannot possibly be construed as insulting when it has anti-white saviour/anti-imperialist tones. Herbert‚Äôs alleged ‚Äòcritique‚Äô of the white saviour trope, however, is certainly not evident in Dune and you are fooling yourself if you believe otherwise. Some readers‚Äîparticularly Muslims/PoC‚Äîhave not taken a liking to this novel for this very reason. As Herbert fanboys will go on to clarify, the series actually goes against the ‚Äòsaviour/messiah‚Äô trope, for Paul is actually an anti-hero! Well, great, but if your introductory book insufferable and off-putting, do you expect readers to stick around to witness your epic revealing in book two or three? Or four or five?

Problematic Paul aside, the novel still panders to distasteful Orientalist tropes. The overt ‚ÄòOthering‚Äô of the native Freman people (whose DESERT planet Arrakis contains the all-important SUBSTANCE melange that everyone in the galaxy wants to get their hands on‚Ä¶ umm middle east oil vibes) paired with the ridiculous (mis)use of Arabic words and phrases made Dune an excruciating read. the only reason I didn‚Äôt DNF it is because I wanted to see if it would redeem itself. (Hint: it didn‚Äôt. If anything, it got worse).

The book is split into three parts, with each chapter demarcated by an unknown ‚ÄòPrincess Irulan‚Äô who narrates random excerpts from various works of someone called the ‚ÄòMuad‚ÄôDib‚Äô. We found out who she is right at the end. Her interruptions weren‚Äôt necessarily irrelevant to the story as a whole, BUT they did counterproductively serve as spoilers and take away the excitement of plot twists. It took away from the story a fair bit and it would‚Äôve been better without. The reader is essentially told everything to come while reading a scene that‚Äôs completely unrelated.

Also the scenes with the children i.e Baby Leto and Alia were added so haphazardly? As if they‚Äôre not major characters/events? He rly flung us two years into the future without any warning LOL.

I‚Äôve witnessed a lot of fans defending this book, arguing that the unnecessary complexity, lack of terminology elaboration, contrived dialogue, mediocre characters and deplorable writing was due to the fact that poor Mr. Herbert wrote this in the 60s and that things were different back then. Stop making excuses. Are we really pardoning his lack of creative writing skill on the fact that sci-fi wasn‚Äôt big in the 60s? lol.

Ultimately, I am giving this novel two stars; one is because I appreciate Herbert‚Äôs *attempt* at writing a sci-fi novel and paving the way, so to speak (it brought about Star Wars/Trek, both of which I enjoy) and the other star is for the major roles female characters played in this book ‚Äì it was refreshing and positively surprising. I also liked the concept of the Bene Gesserit and found their reasoning for the breeding of the Kwisatz Haderach fascinating.

If you still want to read this, I‚Äôd recommend the audiobook which is more dramatised and entertaining.

How typical is it that the movie has not a SINGLE Arab or Muslim in the cast lol. But it‚Äôs fine, they have Zendaya! Arab? Asian? who cares, as long as there‚Äôs one brown person! ü§© I‚Äôm intrigued to see how the movie compares to the book and how heavily it‚Äôll be altered. I already know they‚Äôre using ‚Äúcrusade‚Äù instead of ‚Äújihad‚Äù so I wonder if they‚Äôll change the rest.

‚ÄúHe wanted you to know he always trusted you completely, always loved you and cherished you. He said he would sooner have mistrusted himself and he had but one regret ‚Äì that he never made you his Duchess.‚Äù

- THE cultural and religious appropriation??????? yer a taqwa, harry! ü™Ñüßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- the plot itself was mediocre and boring
- the characters were annoying. the female ones were quite well written tho which is surprising !
- the writing: a lot of waffle - expected bc it is sci fi however he explains none of the words/terminology. at all. so u have to flit between glossary and the main text every other page. impractical and annoying üíØ
- absolute mockeryyyyyy of arab culture lmfaooooo (pro: will make u laugh!)
- mediocre plot twists üò¥ü•±
- excessively long. there was literally no reason for this book to be so long. cut the waffle and it could be a sweet 200-300 pages MAX.

For me, Dune worked excellent. It has striking multi-pov and I have to admit it was hard to get used to that, and half the readers who will hate it, they will do so because of it extremely weird multipov where often several characters' first-person thoughts were laid out in italics. Yeah, the author did that. Yet, I have to say, it had one of the best world building that I have ever seen in a sci-fi. I have seen world building in Harry Potter, in Hobbit, in Song of Ice and Fire, in Name of the Wind, Mistborn and many other high fantasies. But never have I ever saw such rich world building with so many weird names in a science fiction world. This is truly epic. I love sci fi. If you ever find an epic sci fi that has as detailed and well planned world as this, never hesitate to recommend me.

I don't know where to start with this book and explaining it to anyone, it's such a masterpiece.

God knows how long it took the author to write it, you can definitely tell it's carefully written; it's just full of depth, details of the characters/surroundings.

Personally I think to fully digest this book, it has to be read two or three times because it's most complex book I've ever read; if you've read it you'll know exactly what I mean.

One thing I would change about it though is the politics, there's a lot of political talk in it but it doesn't affect my rating one iota.

I've never seen the David Lynch adaptation of this so I'll need to see what that's like, I'm also looking forward to the new adaptation - it looks really cool.

When people ask me what my favorite book is, Dune is always my answer. Words cannot even do justice to what an epic tale this is. We learn about spirituality, human nature, politics, religion, and the making of a hero.

I loved the spiritual aspects of the book the best. The philosophies and practices and Pranu Bindu training of the Bene Gesserit that Paul learns and builds upon. The Bene Gesserit believe in a training regiment that results in a superior human being - one with every sense as refined as possible. This means a focus on learning, on controlling emotion, on controlling your body.

My absolute favorite quote from Dune is the Bene Gesserit litany against fear:



The litany is meant to be recited when you are in a moment of fear, and as I first read Dune 20 years ago, I've employed it many times. After Paul employs it when he is fighting Jamis, the affect on him is described as "a cool bath washing over him. He felt muscles untie themselves, become poised and ready." I have read a lot about people who perform at high levels - whether it be in athletics or business, and success is all about getting into that zen state where you have a clear, focused mind. Fear is the biggest thing that can cloud one's mind - usually fear of failure, but there are other forms too. While this Litany won't always eliminate it, I've felt it to be useful to recognize the fear and call it out for what it is.

There is also a focus in the book on being able to read people by paying attention to the minutia. In many crucial scenes we see Paul and Jessica and others employing this skill, using not only their eyes, but reading the tone of what a person says, what their body language or actions say, and more. Imagine the poker player I could be if I learned these skills!



It's interesting to me that so many science fiction novels contemplate a future with AI (aka post-singularity). In Dune, the was the human rebellion to rid itself of AI or "thinking machines". They are now banned, and in their place we have Mentats, who are humans with processing powers far greater than any thinking machine. It's unclear to the software engineer in me how exactly that could be without some sort of physical manipulation (insertion of massive amounts of transistors, for instance), but the affect is pretty cool, we get Spock-esque beings who analyze everything extremely logically, and are great at political planning "feints within feints within feints".

There was a lot in the book about leadership. It started with Paul first learning about it from his Father, and also from the Bene Gesserit. This quote stood out to me:



Later as he grows into a leader himself, Paul learns that the most essential ingredient to be a leader is to lead people to a worthy goal.



Much has been made in modern reviews of Dune of the fact that it's clearly a statement about oil and the Middle East. The book even admits the Fremen are of Sunni descent, and many words they use (Jinn, Jihad, etc) are Arabic. I'm not sure I understand all the undertones, but one thing that was clear was about control of the worlds most precious commodity: "The people who can destroy a thing, they control it." I hope we are closing in on the end of the days when oil controls so much, but we aren't there yet. In the meantime, we had best beware of any future Harkonnen's.

$1.99 Kindle sale, June 12, 2017, for this epic, classic science fiction novel. It's a lifelong favorite of mine, one of the reasons I'm a science fiction fan. Here's my personal Dune odyssey:

My dad was also a fan of SF and, as a young teen and a hardcore bookworm, I used to regularly raid his book collection. (I also found the stack of naughtier SF books that he kept in his closet, but that's another story.) I was probably 13 the first time I tried to read . I was enthralled by the scene where young Paul Atreides has to stick his hand in the Box of Pain, with the poisonous gom jabbar needle being held at his neck by an old Bene Gesserit crone, ready to kill him if he pulls out his hand. And then I quickly came to a stumbling halt with the book. I tried again when I was about 14: same result. I was just too young for it.

With some trepidation I pulled off the shelf again when I was 15 or 16 (I don't know I was so stubborn with this book! maybe it was all the glowing blurbs on the cover). And THIS time I got over the hump and was swept away into the incredibly intense world of Arrakis, the desert world that is the sole source of the Spice, the vividly imagined giant desert worms, strange cultures and peoples, betrayal and corruption, love, destiny, and a duke's son who is trying to find his place and, oh, by the way, stay alive. Whew!

My highest recommendation! Seriously, go read this if you haven't. (But feel free to skip the sequels; they were afterthoughts.)

2.50 Stars. I tried, I really did but I just can‚Äôt. This was a reread for me. I read this in early high school after discovering Ender's Game in 7th grade and someone telling me if I loved that book I would love Dune. Ah no! I would take a million Andrew Wiggins before I had to read about another Paul Atreides. Anyway, in high school I found the book to be wicked dry and I could not stand Paul. After rereading this, while I do have more appreciation for the world building, it is still really slow in parts and I still don‚Äôt want anything to do with Paul/Jesus.

I wanted to reread this since I was going to watch the movie and was hoping it was just a case of 14-year-old me not liking something that adult me would. Instead, I forgot how boring the book could be in places and I had forgotten how annoying it was to have spoilers given to us at the start of each chapter (from the princess). While I did make it to the end of the book, I must admit I skimmed on multiple occasions when I started to feel sleepy.

There were some parts that really do not hold up well, but I didn‚Äôt take that into account in my rating. I can‚Äôt be surprised that a book has homophobia and sexism when it was written in the 60‚Äôs. If this book were written today, then I‚Äôd have plenty to pick apart.

I did end up seeing the new movie (I‚Äôve watched the old movie too but remember it being so weird that I had no idea what was happening) and I actually liked the new movie better than the book. As a big time reader I feel weird saying that, but I think it solved some of the issues I had with the book. However, Paul was still Paul and the movie can‚Äôt fix that so overall I didn‚Äôt like the movie half as much as everyone else seems to. I guess I just have to lose some geek points because Dune is not for me.

Inevitably, everybody seems to be revisiting Dune in some way or the other.

I don‚Äôt have too much to add to all the discussion, other than to remind anybody who is interested that the book was initially published in the 1960s (and by a publishing company printing automotive manuals, no less, since nobody else seemed interested).

The rest is history, of course.

Dune has since gone on to become one of the highest selling Science Fiction novels of all time, and has received numerous critical accolades over the decades. Chances are that just about all of your favourite Space Operas (in whichever form or format) would never have existed if it had not been for this book.

has aged extremely well, possibly because of the way it skirts the subject of A.I. (or computer technology). It‚Äôs worth noting that this was not an omission on the author‚Äôs behalf. Without going into spoilers, ‚Äúthinking machines‚Äù are prohibited in the Dune universe (there is a reason for this, but I won‚Äôt waste your time with details).

Or, it could just be because Herbert was such a fine writer.

As a side note, there are those that push the boundaries of the above prohibition, so there are some technologies that make appearances as the series progresses.

The 2021 film obviously a lot (it is gorgeous to look at for the most part) but it very little. This can be either good or bad, depending on your bent as a movie-goer, but if you are a reader, you owe it to yourself to read this book (even if it is just to give you the right to critique). There is much more going on beneath the surface.

Herbert explores a number of themes, and the book is as poignant as it is exciting. It‚Äôs remarkable that all the events taking place here is accounted for in one book.





I never wrote much of a review for Dune ‚Äì since I had read it before the Goodreads era ‚Äì but‚Ä¶


This is such a magical book for me. I‚Äôm not even going to attempt to write an objective review. I simply don‚Äôt have the words.

Yes, this rating is based on emotion and on how this book affected me and my reading evolution over the years. And, frankly, that‚Äôs the best way to gauge it, anyway.

Long live the King!

Best in its genre. This book builds its greatly imagined world and a fight for personal stakes, political power, and also for spices. Dune didn't just create a world. It also gave a character that I could really root for.

I tried, I didn't like it. It was hard for me to get into the plot. Quite frankly most of this book was boring. I can see how this is considered a classic work and is entitled to the credit it deserves. This story had some decent points and descriptive language that added character to the story. The overall story plot included hidden messages of political intrigue and the rise and fall of empires, environmentalism, and even religious undertones that all added to create this 'space opera' epic. Having said all that, it still didn't grab my attention.

The only one thing I thought was neat was the transliterated Arabic language inferences throughout the story. Some examples were (mahdi, kull wahad, hajj, jihad, kitab, lisan al-ghaib). I'm sure there were other languages used in adding dimension to this world but I was unable to identify them off hand.

I only read this book because it has been suggested to me for years now. Now that I've finally gotten around to it, at least now I know it wasn't for me. Thanks!

Als Teenager hatte ich mir Anfang der 80er die komplette Serie gekauft. Sci-Fi-Epen gab es damals nicht so viele. Mit Perry Rhodan hatte ich sehr fr√ºh begonnen. Lem und Asimov konnten mich als Junge nicht so reizen. Ansonsten bot die Fantasy f√ºr mich mehr Abwechslung als das Sci-Fi-Genre. Da war die Vorstellung von einer W√ºstenwelt mit V√∂lkern, die sich bek√§mpfen und Intrigen innerhalb der H√§user echt ein Reiz. Und dann noch der gigantische Sandwurm auf dem alten Heyne-Cover. Ich wollte es unbedingt lesen, aber es √ºberforderte mich als jungen Leser. Ich setzte zweimal an. Erst beim dritten Mal konnte ich Band 1 komplett lesen.

Ich fand ihn faszinierend, aber er hatte seine L√§ngen. Begeistert hatte mich der Detailreichtum, mit der Frank Herbert seine Welt aufbaut und erkl√§rt. Interessanterweise wurde der Roman in der Erinnerung immer besser. Frank Herbert hat da etwas ganz Gro√ües erschaffen. Er war f√ºr mich Wegbereiter f√ºr viele andere Weltraumabenteuer, wie z.B. Star Wars. Daher wird der Roman immer Kultstatus behalten. Da hat auch David Lynchs sehr freie und verk√ºrzte Verfilmung nichts daran ge√§ndert.

Nachtrag: Die Neuverfilmung von Denis Villeneuve aus dem Jahr 2021 ist absolut gro√üartig, da sie sehr nahe am Buch bleibt, ohne den Zuschauer mit zu viel Hintergrundinformation zu belasten. Villeneuve nimmt sich aber auch die Freiheit, Band 1 in zwei Filmen mit √ºber 5 Stunden Laufzeit zu erz√§hlen. Das ganze Dune-Universum ist einfach fantastisch konzipiert. Ich muss meine Bewertung nun doch auf 5 Sterne erh√∂hen.

I loved doing an in-depth reread of this masterpiece.

This classic is a rich blend of science fiction and fantasy. The world-building is a hurdle for some readers, but it's one of the most impressive and grounding aspects of the story for me. I love the political structure‚Äîa tense balance between the emperor, nobility, and space travel guild; all while the religious order pulls strings to keep influence in the most powerful families. Then there is the planet itself with its creatures and natives, the scarce but essential spice resource at the heart of all the conflict, and all the weapons, suits, vehicles, and shelters that are fully imagined and realized. It feels real, it's so well-developed.

This plot also hits for me every time. The natives harbor precious secrets and skills. There is so much intrigue in this story chapter upon chapter, and so many competent and deadly characters playing their parts. It's like watching an imperial chess match on the grandest of scales. And it never gets old for me.

The heart of this story is the characters, and the exploration of culture, tradition, and customs as an incredibly formidable power humans may possess. The Atreides house is so impressive from a purely tactical and practical standpoint, but beyond that, the Atreides inspire loyalty. Their men never break under pressure. They can never be swayed to corruption. They are such wise, compassionate, and cunning leaders. And I fall harder for them every time I read this story. The Fremen also display such incredible unity and collective behavior.

I come away from this story inspired by the outmaneuvering of corruption, the brilliance of not being stagnant, the power of observation, and the strength in mastering the self. I feel moved by the devotion the characters have to one another; that love grounds them when they are most corruptable by heavy burdens of power and responsibility...terrible purpose. This is a story about love for home and family and the lengths one will go to protect and honor and avenge them. Beyond that, it's a story about being the better person, in absolutely every possible way.

It's one of the greats. It is one of the leaders in the genre to this day, and for good reason.

So, I've reread the book and watched the movie.

First, the movie: visually, it's impecable, and the actors well chosen. The story follows the storyline quite accurately, however the worldbuilding and characters' background are missing entirely. One who did not read the book will understand nothing from it, fact already confirmed. Its message is nonexistent. The fact that it's just part one doesn't help either. The secondary characters are mainly puppets; the focus is on Paul, and Paul alone. And no other can make this movie to match the book, because it's an impossible task: the story and characters alike have too many layers to be transposed on screen. What Villeneuve did was the best possible outcome. But from the entartainment factor's PoV it's great; well worth it watching in 3D.

Now the book: I wanted to reread it for years, but I was afraid that after so many other great sci-fi stories, I wouldn't like it just as much. I was wrong. The best thing about rereading a book is that you are able to focus on details, rather than the plot or main thread, and to better understand it. And that was exactly the case here. I love the worldbuilding, the multiple layers, how Paul is actually an antihero from a PoV.

One more thing: only now I have realized how much inspiration George Lucas drew from this book for the first Star Wars movies. I don't know how I didn't see it before, although I have read about this. I guess the info didn't sink in until now.

Some sci-fi books are not aging well at all, but Dune will always be contemporary with the reader. It is now more actual than ever.

-----

Have to recall the lost details before seeing the movie, on which I have my doubts, but we'll see.

What can I say about Dune that hasn't already been said countless times? It's a masterpiece. Not just of the science fiction genre, but in general. It can be viewed on so many different levels, from political, philosophical, scientific, or simply as a fantastic adventure novel... and it works so well, no matter which angle you look at it from, because Herbert treats each of them as equally important.

This is not going to be a long review. My words cannot do this novel justice. I know my abilities as a writer, and I'm just not up to it. All I will say is that I read this book when I was 13 initially, and felt it was the greatest science fiction novel I had ever read at the time. Reading it now in my 30s, I agree with past me completely, but for different reasons. 13 year old me, didn't get the genius of this book. He didn't see what was playing out between the lines. My favorite scene as I read the book this time involved a dinner party. It is quite possibly the most suspenseful scene I've ever read, and when you really look at the scene, all that happens is a very long conversation. It's a constant game of wits where the reader and the characters tries to figure out where the guests' allegiances lie, and while some are clear from the start, others are not so much. I didn't see the depth of this at the time, and even now I feel there is so much hidden in the pages that I only could catch glimpses of... but the world Herbert has created is unforgettable.

A full 5/5 stars and my highest possible recommendation.

Familiar yet strange, realistic yet fantastic, prosaic yet poetic, crystal clear yet mysterious, stiff yet graceful, cold yet passionate, detailed yet abstract, rational yet delirious, disciplined yet boundless, conservative yet progressive, obsessive yet sublime ‚Äì aaah, I think the spice melange is starting to kick in...

I read a few years ago that if you've not found Dune of your own accord by the time you've got to marriageable age, you're probably not a Dune sort of person. I'm sorry, you guys, I've let the side down. 320 pages, and I'm forced to conclude that Paul Atreides and I were never meant to be.

When I admitted this to the lender of the book last night, he said some combination of "ehh, your loss"/"BUT THE WORLDBUILDING". And that's the thing, worldbuilding alone isn't enough for me. I felt this way about when I read it the year before last - the worldbuilding was fabulous, and similarly intricate. But I am the sort of person who enjoys shadow puppetry, who can be given a very few details, and is happy to hang the world off those and concentrate on the action. When you have that almost suffocatingly intricate worldbuilding - and yes, it is very impressive! and so is Mi√©ville's in - then you have passed the point where I can picture it, and you are headed very much towards making me claustrophobic. made me feel claustrophobic, and I didn't like it. I appreciate it for the nods I've seen to it in other media - I bet would be even better now, there's such clear homage to it - especially in terms of the economic system. I'm really happy Frank Herbert did this thing. I just wish he'd done it somewhere else.

And the rest feels old to me; it feels stale. It feels like when you've seen everyone and the Muppets do their own variations on it. It's like , terribly self-important and a genre forerunner, but with nothing that still feels fresh, all this time later. I'm glad, of course, that was written, but mostly because it paved the way for some fantastic things that came after it and because of it. It feels like a piece of backstory, something for the vampire completists. also feels like that.

I don't care about Paul, who is a haughty special snowflake, and with whom I can't identify. I don't care about his mother. We wouldn't be friends. There are a few characters I feel the flicker of rooting for (and "Duncan Idaho" is the best war hero name I've ever heard). I lost patience with Baron Von Terrible in less than a page. I don't like Arrakis, I wouldn't like to go there. So I don't feel any compulsion towards for its characters' sake, much less its place in sci-fi canon.

It's really odd to me, because I want to like hard sci-fi, and I think I like its defining characteristics, its direction and its outlook. Those things are all fascinating. But in a similar way, I like the characteristics and outlook of a lot of romance novels. With both sci-fi and romance, though, if I can't care for the characters, if I can't get excited about the plot, if I can't read the damn prose without something clenching in my stomach, then everything is ruined, no matter how good the idea is.

It's strange, I had a similar feeling about a decade ago with , which I later came back to and discovered was a revelation. So all is not completely lost. But in the meantime, , I'm sorry. It's not you, it's me. But also it's you. We just don't have anything to say to each other.

(P.S. I don't root for people with concubines. I don't, and you can't make me.)

I've loved science fiction my whole life, but I was finally told that I couldn't call myself a SF fan if I hadn't read Dune. So I read it. I know Dune is worshipped as a paragon of groundbreaking SF, I can witness and acknowledge Herbert's genius, and I can understand that when it was written it was certainly seminal, but I still don't think much of it.

Aside from Herbert's horribly annoying use of 3rd-person-omnipotent viewpoint, he's just not a good writer. For clarification: he's a fantastic story-teller and creator. He has an incredible imagination and a talent for world-building and interweaving complex storylines. But the actual craft of writing, well, he just can't write worth 2 beans. As a result, I found Dune nearly impossible to get through.

Story-wise, I got bored with all the political stuff because it's not my thing, and I got bored with all the preaching about ecology. But I loved the elements that dealt more closely with the human drama, the personal choices characters make, their interactions with others, how they cope internally with themselves and their own strengths and weaknesses. Those are the stories I like. There was enough of that here to make me check out the sequel from the library, but after about 10 pages of Herbert's writing I just couldn't stomach any more.

Siamo nell'anno 10191 dopo la nascita della Gilda Spaziale, la Terra √® dimenticata nelle ombre della storia, i computer sono banditi cos√¨ come qualsiasi forma di IA, i viaggi interplanetari sono esclusiva dei potenti e gestiti dalla Gilda Spaziale, le Grandi Casate governano con un sistema feudale sotto il potere dell'Imperatore, la Spezia √® la pi√π grande risorsa dell'universo conosciuto e viene raccolta su un solo pianeta....DUNE.

Commentare un'opera come Dune, e parlo esclusivamente della saga composta dai 6 romanzi di Frank Herbert, non √® affatto semplice.
Herbert ci porta su altri mondi ai confini del tempo e dello spazio in un contesto in cui l'umanit√† √® al centro di tutto.
Niente astronavi, niente computer, niente robot, qui si parla solo di uomini, di politica, complotti, raggiri, drammi, sopravvivenza, destino e profezie.

Dune √® un viaggio nella mente dei personaggi, le loro paure, le angosce e le soluzioni per la sopravvivenza sono al centro della narrazione.

Gi√† agli inizi del primo romanzo avrete un assaggio del tono riflessivo che vi attende: la prova del "Gom Jabbar": la mente pu√≤ controllare gli istinti? Siete uomini o animali? Fin dove la mente umana pu√≤ spingersi? Poca azione e tanta riflessione.

Herbert presenta una fantascienza involuta sul piano tecnologico proprio per esaltare le capacit√† umane.
Avrete gruppi di umani selezionati, che in mancanza (voluta) della tecnologia si sono specializzati per raggiungere vette mentali e fisiche oltre la concezione di semplice uomo.
Le Bene Gesserit: sorellanza dalle capacit√† psico-fisiche superiori, i Mentat: computer umani, il Bene Tleilax: conoscitori dei segreti della genetica, i Navigatori della Gilda: unici in grado di eseguire i calcoli per viaggiare nello spazio profondo.

Tutti umani, ma con capacit√† al limite del sovraumano, frutto della ferrea specializzazione e selezione genetica avvenuta nel corso di migliaia di anni, archetipi che vi rimarranno in mente per il resto della vostra vita.

Di carne al fuoco ce n'√® tanta, il primo romanzo mette solo le basi per il vero messaggio epico dell'opera, fermarsi qui √® peccato mortale, sta a voi scoprire e capire cos'√® il Sentiero Dorato. L'anima del ciclo di Dune.

Se amate le opere letterarie che non si limitano a raccontare una storia, anche a discapito dell'azione, siete obbligati ad immergervi in Dune.
EPICO e irraggiungibile.

----------------------------
We are in the year 10191 after the birth of the Space Guild, the Earth is forgotten in the shadows of history, computers are banned as well as any form of AI, interplanetary travel is exclusive to the powerful and managed by the Space Guild, the Great Houses govern with a feudal system under the power of the Emperor, Spice is the greatest resource in the known universe and is harvested on just one planet....DUNE.

Commenting on a work like Dune, and I'm talking exclusively about the saga made up of Frank Herbert's 6 novels, is not at all simple.
Herbert takes us to other worlds at the edge of time and space in a context where humanity is at the center of everything.
No spaceships, no computers, no robots, here we only talk about men, politics, conspiracies, deceptions, dramas, survival, destiny and prophecies.

Dune is a journey into the minds of the characters, their fears, anxieties and solutions for survival are at the center of the narrative.

Already at the beginning of the first novel you will have a taste of the reflective tone that awaits you: the test of "Gom Jabbar": can the mind control the instincts? Are you men or animals? How far can the human mind go? Little action and a lot of reflection.

Herbert presents science fiction that is technologically involved precisely to enhance human capabilities.
You will have groups of selected humans, who in the (deliberate) lack of technology have specialized to reach mental and physical heights beyond the conception of simple man.
The Bene Gesserit: sisterhood with superior psycho-physical abilities, the Mentat: human computers, the Bene Tleilax: knowledgeable of the secrets of genetics, the Guild Navigators: the only ones capable of performing the calculations to travel in deep space.

All human, but with abilities bordering on the superhuman, the result of the iron specialization and genetic selection that took place over thousands of years, archetypes that will remain in your mind for the rest of your life.

There is a lot of irons in the fire, the first novel only lays the foundations for the true epic message of the work, stopping here is a mortal sin, it is up to you to discover and understand what the Golden Path is. The soul of the Dune series.

If you love literary works that don't just tell a story, even at the expense of action, you're forced to immerse yourself in Dune.
EPIC and unattainable.

I like books for different reasons - characters, writing style, exciting plot. I will remember "Dune" for its remarkable world-building.

Dune (or Arrakis) is a desert planet. It is barren, almost waterless, and it is the only source of melange - a spice with unique geriatric qualities - it extends lives, enhances mental abilities, and is necessary for space travel. Dune is at the center of an Imperial scheme to bring down the influential House of Atreides led by Duke Leto Atreides. The plan is to give Leto the rights to extract spice on Dune, the rights that previously belonged to Atreides' century-long enemy - House of Harkonnen with Baron Vladimir Harkonnen as its head. The feud between the Houses is later used as a cover-up for the extermination of the House of Atreides. This plan however has a flaw, as it doesn't take into consideration that Leto Atreides's 15-year old son Paul is not an ordinary child, but the end product of a long-term genetic experiment designed to breed a super human. It's Paul's destiny to give Dune back to its native people - Fremen and to upset the power balance in the Universe.

Having finished "Dune," I now understand why this book is considered to be for science fiction what "Lord of the Rings" is for fantasy - basically, it's a standard all other works in the genre are compared against.

The world of Dune has an unprecedented depth to it. Herbert creates an entire culture built around the world that simply has not enough water. This planetary condition affects Fremen tremendously - they constantly wear stillsuits that are designed to conserve and recycle bodies' water emissions, dead bodies are processed to extract water, the population is controlled to accommodate the a total amount of water available. I found this world extremely interesting and well thought out.

The concepts of Bene Gesserit (a school of mental and physical abilities whose hidden mission is to advance humanity through various genetic manipulations), Mentats (people trained for supreme accomplishments of logic, human computers), Missionara Protectiva (a wing of Bene Gesserit order whose goal is to plant superstition on primitive worlds to later make these regions easier for the order to manipulate), etc. are equally fascinating.

The depth of the world, however, is the biggest weakness of the book as well as its biggest strength. It takes a while to figure out various concepts and terms which are introduced early on (thankfully, there is a very helpful glossary at the end of the book). The narration is a little too dry at times, especially when characters' mental abilities are explored. The book is in many ways happens inside people's minds, so there is a lot of thinking and analyzing involved.

But these negatives aside, "Dune" is rightfully called a masterpiece of science fiction. It is much more that a story about aliens and space travel, it is an ambitious philosophical work which explores the issues of ecology, cultural identity and the nature of religious leadership. Although I am not sure I will read the rest of the books in the series (as far as I know the total book count is now 16), I will always remember "Dune" as an impressive work of literature which will definitely stand the test of time.

P.S. I also watched David Lynch's movie adaptation of the book. My advice - spare yourself, DO NOT watch it.

Dune, widely considered to be the greatest and most important Science-Fiction novel ever. I haven‚Äôt really read, well, any sci-fi before so kicking my foray off with this entry was a great way to start.

‚ÄúFear is the mind-killer.‚Äù

We follow a select few Point of Views who are all associated in one way or another, with the desert planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. On Arrakis there is an extreme lack of moisture, a blood-feud between families, a spice called Melange which is invaluable to it‚Äôs owner, a tribal society and giant, fearsome, terrifying Sandworms. There is a lot to the history and current affairs of the galaxy and Frank Herbert does an excellent job of exploring many avenues of interest throughout this intriguing planet.



The Atreides family are the protagonists, all round good guys, with fantastic characters such as Duke Leto, Gurney Halleck, Duncan Idaho, Jessica a ‚ÄòBene Dessert‚Äô concubine and her son Paul Atreides, the heir to the family. There are lots of well crafted relationships within this faction. The blurb of Dune tells us that the family are betrayed and destroyed, and considering it takes quite a few pages to get to that point I‚Äôd have much preferred to have been able to figure it out for myself. The opposing faction, the Harkonnen‚Äôs are as well crafted as the Atreides, if not even more enjoyable. The slimy and devious Baron Vladmir is a fantastic antagonist. He brutally plots, is clever and there is no evil act that he is not willing to commit to see the downfall of his nemesis Atreides.



I really enjoy my read of Dune. The prose is very strong, and the descriptions of the world of Arrakis are beautiful. It is science fiction but really not in your face with the science of it all, but it feels very real. Very realistic to the point I forgot it was indeed a sci-fi book. Herbert is a well-rounded storyteller with enough detail of characters, their inhibitions and description, as well as consistent plotting and intrigue. Unfortunately I found Paul, the main character to be the weakest of the cast. I disliked just how much we were in his head and how he was pretty much perfect, but it was written in the 60s and I understand that what modern books I read are trying to steer clear of that approach.



Still, Dune is a remarkable story and will keep you on the edge of your seat (in your ornithopter). There is so much depth to Dune, the world and its characters. Impressive is the word, really. I would recommend it to to anyone, it covers different preferences and will tick a lot of boxes for lots of people.

The book is brilliant. Delightfully difficult in every sense: from the thoughtful to the smallest details of the Arrakis world order, sophisticated political intrigues, complex interpersonal relationships, to the delightful message with spice.

Melange, which has such a diverse spectrum of action (a vital component of interstellar travel, a stimulant that allows you to drive ships through collapsed space), greatly slows down aging, a light drug without abstinence is finally the only place in the universe where they are mined, and there is no way to synthesize, even with the highest level of technology there, which means a monopoly. And whoever owns the Dune owns the world.At least she can dictate terms to him. At the same time, to call this planet the ass of the world would be to flatter her greatly.

It's just a scorched desert with nothing but sand, birds like crows, and jumping muaddib mice. Oh, and the worms that started it all. Creatures the size of a car or a house, which live under the sand, but react sensitively to any rhythmic movement on its surface, and when surfaced, they are able to swallow a destroyer in one fell swoop. And the fremen. I listened to the book and all the time I perceived the self-designation of these people as "freemen", free, but Vika says that it is necessary to use the "e", even so, although they are, in fact, free and quite wild. Like the Tuareg of Earth.

Everything in the book is cool. A teenager who is destined to survive in difficult trials and become a ruler. But without the usual fabulous "honest feast, yes for the wedding," "they lived happily ever after," "I was there, I drank honey and beer, but I only wet my mustache." A prisoner of prophetic visions provoked by spice (such
a specific influence), he knows from the very beginning that his purpose is not to rule the world or, there, to establish an empire, but to stop jihad. And you will have to put your life on it.

That his fate will be inextricably linked with the fate of his mother, whose filial devotion comes into the most severe contradiction with the rebellion of a strong freedom-loving nature against literally cutting according to the patterns prescribed by the Gesserit Order, to which Lady Jessica belongs from infancy. The novel, which was published in the sixty-fifth year of the last century, is an unthinkable Klondike of foresight and insights. Not in terms of fantastic technology, but in political technologies, social trends (what is an order if not the quintessence of feminist ideas?)

I loved Dune, although I'm not saying some facets of it couldn't be seen as problematic. It's one of those books that I know I'll be rereading, and also one of those books that you know you are not seeing quite the full scope of on your first read through.

It's precisely because of that that I will not be reviewing this book on the blog. First of all, it's been reviewed all the times it needs to be reviewed by people much more capable than me ‚Äì because it's an old and legendary book. (yes, body image, queer rep, the eugenics, the diversity issues, the white savior complexes... all of that is there and I won't deny it). So I don't really want to delve into it, and also especially because I kind of feel that Dune was bigger than me, and I don't know if I can do it justice.

And it made me THINK so much. The book is like a game of chess! It's also basically epic fantasy, posing as scifi. Dune is a phenomenon that I think deserves its own shelf, and I can only marvel at the story-weaving genius that Frank Herbert was.


- the Fremen and their incredible culture
- the impeccable honor that some of the characters possessed
- the philosophy of the Bene Gesserit, despite their awful scheming ways
- the slightly New Age vibe to the whole narrative
- simply the way it blew my mind with its twisted storytelling

Yes, of course Dune has problems - mostly because it was written in 1965. But I don't think we shouldn't be able to enjoy it like we enjoy many of the other classics (which are admittedly often much more problematic than Dune.) I truly loved this story. I can recommend it for how smart, ingenious and different it is from anything else I've read. It was quite unforgettable.

Dune is one of those sci-fi novels where you get hit by a stream of dense, exotic-sounding coinages and no explanations about where we are or what's happening. It reads like there was a prologue which was removed before publication. Our hero, Paul Atreides, is also known as Muad'dib, and having endured the gom jabbar may be the Kwisatz Haderach foretold by the Bene Geserrit as well as the Lisan al-Gaib predicted by the ijaz of the Fremen, otherwise known as Usul in his home sietch‚Ä¶etc.

The exposition can be a little clunky at times, too. How's this for subtly introducing the identity of a new character:


To which my initial reaction was: Nevertheless, there is a certain charm to it all, the characters are a lot more than cardboard cutouts, and the world-building, prefiguring everything from to , is complex and excellent.



The story itself is a very classical hero-narrative (deliberately so ‚Äì Herbert was a big fan of Joseph Campbell), which moves slowly but has all kinds of interesting details. Perhaps surprisingly, it felt to me like a real product of the 60s in many ways, with a central role given to mind-altering substances and an important ecological theme ‚Äì the book is dedicated to ‚Äòdry-land ecologists‚Äô. ( was popularised among the countercultural community after being included in Stuart Brand's , in a completely unexpected link with my other recent reading.) But all of these factors also make it quite relevant today, not least the depiction of a religiously fanatical desert community being exploited for the hugely profitable substance found by drilling into the sands. Those are all just added extras, though ‚Äì if you don't enjoy the prospect of a big, sprawling political science-fiction saga then you're not going to get much out of the various subplots.



This Folio Society edition is kind of gorgeous, featuring these absolutely exquisite illustrations from Sam Weber, as well as a badly-written afterword from Brian Herbert which does not incline me to read the later sequels he wrote from his father's notes. I probably should have read this twenty years ago, but I'd still consider it a good, foundational piece of sci-fi, which sheds light on several aspects of the tradition and can still be enjoyed plenty for its own sake. And now, a naked slave-girl:

Frank Herbert's science fiction novel 'Dune', first printed in 1965, is the first in his six-book series. There are books after the first six in the series, written by the author's son Brian Herbert and other collaborators after Frank Herbert's death. The six books primarily follow the aristocrat Atreides family through several generations (in fact, millennia - I read all six Frank H. books years ago). I loved them, but I was only a YA at the time. I wasn't sure I would still like them today. Good news! I did still like 'Dune'!

However, those readers who prefer action-packed thrillers in which scenes resembling those movie black-ops fights with fast editing cuts predominant will not enjoy 'Dune'.

The six Dune books go deep into the science and art of political leadership, especially into those practical facets of how to draw a populace into a revolution or guerrilla insurgency. Also, depending on whether your religious education is shallow or deep, some readers may pick up on the author Frank Herbert's other main theme: ruling political classes everywhere in all times historical and present, and very likely in the future as Frank Herbert so astutely surmises, intentionally and knowingly develop, maintain and manipulate local and world religions as a mechanism to control and direct common people into behaving as the leaders require. Religion is used by leaders on religious believers the same way equestrians control horses through a mouth bit. Political Science majors as well as amateur political junkies and students will snicker knowingly as they read 'Dune', seeing the political-religious manipulations. The rest of us will admire the science-based science fiction world-building.

The ‚ÄòDune‚Äô world at the beginning of Herbert's space opera is one of: competing Aristocrat 'Houses' who control planets; the Guild, who control interstellar travel; the Emperor, who is the military/political leader of the large and small Houses; and finally the mystical Bene Gesserit. The Bene Gesserit are actually blackops fems privately, while they publically advise politicos on matters of religion and politics. The Bene Gesserit practice Buddhist-type exercises that control the mind and body. They are also conducting a top-secret genetics program through arranged marriages and concubines. All of these organizations are joined militarily and politically to each other through the business of acquiring a m√©lange, a sort of a spice, found only on one planet in the universe, the almost waterless Dune, also known as Arrakis.

I think Herbert is a genius at hidden irony. He changes what was the work of customarily male missionaries on Earth into a girl-power production in the Dune universe. Almost all religions around the real Earth promise a Messiah of sorts. At this point in our real-time, the Messiah has come (or not) depending on what real-life (primarily Jewish, Christian and Muslim faiths) religion Earth believers believe in. The main character in Dune, Paul Atreides, is a Messiah character similar to our current Christian, Jewish or Muslim Messiahs. But in Herbert's plot, Paul is a 'fake news' Messiah created by the Bene Gesserit. They have been spreading around the galaxy rumors, myths and fake mysticism/magic displays for thousands of years, preaching about the coming of a Messiah-like person. The women are publically similar to our real-world Jesuit Catholic/Buddhist proselytizing and practice.

Spice is a miracle drug, fueling the minds of some humans who use it regularly with extraordinary mental powers of perception. Without it, the Guild navigators can't navigate through space between thousands of planets, enabling trade and travel, and the aristocrats would not be incredibly wealthy through their awarded shares of Spice profits through the Choam Company, the official Spice sales and distribution company. It follows that whoever controls the mining of Spice on the desert planet Dune, the sole source of Spice, controls also unimaginable access to power and wealth. It is the Emperor's privilege to select among the Great Houses who will be in charge of Dune. The House which is selected must also be responsible for the complete subjugation of the indigenous population, called the Fremen. The various Houses some time ago have had some success with enslaving or brutalizing the locals, but many of the toughened natives escaped and disappeared into the harsh deserts, adopting a lifestyle much like Earth's Middle-eastern tribes in the past. There also are annoying man-eating giant worms who are attracted by any noise in the deserts of Dune, so the mining of Spice deposits, only found in the deserts of Arrakis, is very tricky. No one really knows anything about the dry hot deserts, the worms or where the Spice deposits come from.

The Emperor and some of the other Houses do not care what methods of subjugation are used on resident planetary populations. Some Houses use torture and slavery and starvation. Needless to say, the Atreides are good people who desire to win their subjects with love and fairness (not democracy, though). However, the Emperor and another House, the Harkonnens, do not love the Atreides because of past conflicts. The two aristocrat houses come up with a plan to destroy the Atreides House forever. First, at least publicly, the Harkonnens are told to give up their home on Dune and to move out, and the Atreides are ordered to take charge of mining the Spice. Fifteen-year-old Paul Atreides and his mother Jessica, the Duke Leto Atreides' Bene Gesserit concubine, feel very apprehensive about the move. Not only do they feel dismay about leaving their home planet Caladan, a water-rich planet, but all the Atreides' suspect a deadly trap is being set with this supposed honor of being given the control of Dune. The Harkonnens are infamously renown for their methods of subjugation, using torture, rape and robbery freely, not caring who or how many of the indigenous population they kill. What legacy traps have the Harkonnens left behind?

There are so many great reviews on Goodreads describing this fantastic novel, I find my usual graphomania has now deserted me.

I will instead link to some of those fantastic reviews:





I also would recommend reading Machiavelli's before, or definitely after, finishing Dune! However, you should be aware that my recommendation of reading the classic nonfiction book of political advice 'The Prince' (it is very short, btw) carries a hint of the creative approach Frank Herbert took in this fictional series. Paul is a moral hero, but he and his descendants also would have been easily the super-practical Vulcan Political Scientist geniuses in the Star Trek universe. From Paul to his children to his children's children, the aristocrat Atreides House becomes a place of four-dimensional political chess game players plotting for the future of the human race. In ‚ÄòDune‚Äô, book one in the Dune series, Paul has to make tough heroic decisions which inspire his fanatical Fremen followers and us, gentle reader. But ultimately, as the series progresses, sentimentality is one of the first things the surviving Atreides jettison.

Dune: The greatest SF novel of all time, never to be matched by later sequels (Review of 1965 Novel, 1984 David Lynch Film, 2000 Sci-Fi Channel Miniseries, and 2013 Jodorowsky documentary)
Originally posted at Fantasy Literature
What more can be said about Frank Herbert‚Äôs 1965 masterpiece? This massive epic of political intrigue, messianic heroes, vile villains, invincible desert fighters, telepathic witches, sandworms and spice, guild pilots who fold space, and a relentless action-packed narrative that still has ample room for beautiful descriptive passages and copious philosophizing on the mythology of the messiah/savior. In short, Dune is a perfect SF novel that both entertains and engages the mind, a book frequently cited as the greatest single work of imagination produced in the genre, rivaled only by J.R.R. Tolkien‚Äôs The Lord of the Rings.

And yet the book had a troubled birth, being rejected by over twenty publishers before being accepted by Chilton Books, better known for publishing repair manuals. How could a book later considered a masterpiece be so roundly rejected? The answer lies in the status and expectations of the genre in the 1960s. At the time, SF was still mainly known for its most famous practitioners, Robert Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, and Isaac Asimov, who represented an older Golden Age of SF, focused mainly on science, technology, and space adventure.

Dune was a completely new creature, so far ahead of its time with it‚Äôs emphasis on a baroque far-future universe dominated by competing Great Houses bound to an Emperor, a guild of space pilots, the matriarchal Bene Gesserit witches, geneticall-modified humans called Mentats that served as computing devices, and the complexities of a galactic economy dependent for commerce on a substance known as the ‚Äúspice‚Äú m√©lange that extends health and lifespan, expands consciousness, and most importantly allows the guild pilots to fold space and connect the disparate planets of the Empire.

In addition, Frank Herbert was very interested in Middle Eastern cultures and Eastern religions like Zen Buddhism, as well as in desert ecologies and the preciousness of water. Weaving this massive and complex group of themes into a coherent, exciting, and moving narrative following the fate of messiah Paul Atreides, later known Muad‚ÄôDib, was a feat that few authors have ever achieved since then, including Frank Herbert himself.

In fact, Dune spawned five sequels directly written by Frank Herbert, and then over 10 books that fill in the numerous details of his universe, written by his son Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, who seems to specialize in co-authoring various series such as Star Wars, X-files, and all kinds of novelizations. Most recently his book The Dark Between the Stars was a 2014 Hugo Award nominee. I'm not really interested in reading these spin-off books, when there are so many other books to be read.

I did read the five sequels written by Herbert back in high school, and it was a punishing experience, as the first two books (Dune Messiah and Children of Dune) deliberately debunked the messiah mythology established in Dune, showing how the Fremen used Paul Atreides‚Äô status as messiah to wage a destructive jihad across the universe. It‚Äôs interesting to hear comments that Herbert intended all along to show what happens when the masses believe in a messiah, and how they participate in the process of creating one. His view is actually quite skeptical, but since Dune is about the rise of the messiah, it benefited from the positive early stage of Paul‚Äôs story arc.

However, his follow-ups quickly drained my enthusiasm. I guess it should come as no surprise that we prefer to be swept along with the rise of a messianic superbeing, rather than observe the messy aftermath after his rise to power, and various political and religious divisions complicate the world after he takes over. Herbert wanted to explore these themes in great detail, but they were certainly much less commercially-appealing that Dune. I found the next three books (God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, Chapterhouse Dune) more interesting but also very complicated and hard to enjoy. Herbert wrote quite a number of other SF novels outside the Dune universe, but he will always be known best for Dune to the exclusion of his other works, and this must have weighed heavily on him as a writer.

The story itself focuses on two feuding families, the House Atreides and House Harkonnen. The latter has been in charge of administering the production of Spice on Arrakis, but as House Atreides has gained in power, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV decided to place the Atreides in charge of Arrakis, with the intention of drawing them into conflict with the Harkonnes and keeping both in check. House Atreides is led by Duke Leto Atreides, his concubine the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica, and Leto‚Äôs son Paul, who is part of a secret breeding program to create a Kwisatz Haderach, a male messiah with incredible mental powers who will lead the Bene Gesserit and humanity to greater heights.

The levels of intrigue and complexity are staggering, and though a description cannot do it proper justice, Herbert‚Äôs complete dedication to his creation recalls the massive world-building achieved by Tolkien in Middle Earth. Despite all the alien concepts, politics, intrigues, warring groups, desert warriors, and mish-mash of Zen Buddism, Islamic and Christian mythology about messiahs and jihads, and the complex economic and ecological implications of the sandworms and spice, the reader is completely drawn into this world and believes in it. It is truly an amazing achievement, recalling how fans embraced George Lucas‚Äô Star Wars universe, but so much more complex, dark, and mature in its themes.

As this was the first time I revisited Dune since high school, I decided to get the ensemble-cast audiobook version. It‚Äôs complete with sounds effects like the sound of desert winds blowing and ominous music, and these are carefully done not to detract from the narration. A note on the narration, however: the books starts out with a full cast of voice actors, but then switches to a single narrator (Simon Vance?) midway and towards the end, with a few scattered scenes with the full cast. It‚Äôs a bit disorienting, especially as the voice of Baron Harkonnen switches from a simpering evil character to a deep-voiced and powerful voice akin to Michael Clarke Duncan. It would have been better to kept the full cast for the entire book, but for some reason it got a bit jumbled. Still, it‚Äôs an excellent audiobook production.



It was inevitable that Dune captured the imaginations of film directors, but the scale and complexity of the story made the transition to film extremely difficult. Film rights were acquired in 1971 but little progress was made until 1974, when a French group acquired the rights and Alejandro Jodorowsky, a Chilean avant-garde film maker, writer/poet and spiritual figure most famous for his 1970 bizarro Western El Topo and The Holy Mountain. His ambitious plans for the film would have reached about 12-20 hours in length, and featured roles for Salvador Dali (lured by ego-stroking), Orson Wells (lured by food and drink), David Carradine, Pink Floyd, Magma, and even Mick Jagger. The artwork would involve the legendary Jean Giraud (of Moebius fame) and H.R. Giger (of Alien fame). Alas, such an ambitious and sprawling project was doomed to failure, and this story is detailed in the 2013 documentary Jodorowsky‚Äôs Dune. I watched this recently, and it‚Äôs a very revealing portrait of an avante-garde artist. His vision was so wild and hallucinogenic that he said audiences would not need to drop LSD because his film could replicate that experience. His statements about his vision are quite eye-opening:







No wonder Frank Herbert disavowed any connection with this project. And despite Jodorowsky‚Äôs clear fascination with the source material, he saw no reason not to change it completely. In fact, he hadn‚Äôt even read the book when he pitched the idea, and his screenplay demonstrates a willful lack of knowledge of the actual events in the book. It‚Äôs not clear that he ever read the book, period, and the same goes for H.R. Giger. Not a biggie when we‚Äôre talking about artists, apparently.



The documentary suggests that, although the film was never actually made, its influence on other SF film projects is huge, probably because the pitch-book made the rounds of the Hollywood studios. The film can take credit for bringing together Dan O‚ÄôBannon (producer of The Dark Star) and H.R. Giger (Swiss artist who created the drawings for Ridley Scott‚Äôs Alien), for getting legendary French artist Moebius to make thousands of storyboard sketches and full-color character drawing, and also well-known SF artist Chris Foss to contribute his iconic spaceships. It ends with a series of overlays of the storyboard with actual films, frequently with astonishing similarities in costumes and images, as diverse as Flash Gordon, Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, He-Man, and Prometheus. While it‚Äôs debatable exactly how much these films were directly inspired, it‚Äôs certainly food for thought. So in the end, though it was probably not ‚ÄúThe Greatest Film Never Made‚Äù, it was an admirably insane and unwieldy project that produced a spurt of creative energy that was simply too much for Hollywood‚Äôs commercial studios. It may have been incredible masterpiece, or a complete and utter disaster, but it‚Äôs unfortunate that we never got to see Jodorowsky‚Äôs mind-altering vision on film.



After plans for Ridley Scott to direct fell through, it was not until 1981 that Dino De Laurentiis‚Äô daughter approached David Lynch to bring Dune to the big screen. Wait, you mean the director of Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, and Twin Peaks? That‚Äôs right. It‚Äôs still a mystery why Lynch chose to direct Dune, since he had not shown interest in the SF genre and had not even read the book (a common theme here). But to his credit, he made a valiant effort to put on film this notoriously difficult and sprawling work.

As could have been predicted, the Lynch film was severely panned by film critics, moviegoers, and fans of the novel. It was dark, confusing, and incoherent (due to excessive cutting to get it to 2 hrs 17 min in length), and the Baron Harkonnen was so physically revolting to look at that I had to turn away from some of his scenes. But it did feature a great soundtrack by Toto (especially the haunting closing credits) with the prophecy theme written by Brian Eno. And it I will never forget Kyle MacLachlan as Paul Atreides in the final climactic scene, a knife fight to the death with Feyd Rautha Harkonnen, played perfectly by Sting! Even Sean Young and Patrick Stewart have important roles as Chani and Gurney Halleck.

But this was another doomed attempt. Try to imagine cramming all the plot details, background information on the political machinations of the dozens of characters and factions, details on the complex ecology of Arrakis, the relationship of the sandworms and spice, the Fremen and Bene Gesserit, into a film just over 2 hours long. The studio‚Äôs demands for cuts were so drastic that Lynch has since dissociated himself from the film and refuses to talk about it. That‚Äôs a shame, because many have revised their initial negative views on the film and I consider it a valiant if failed attempt at scaling the Everest of SF films.



This is by far the least well-known version of Frank Herbert‚Äôs SF masterpiece. In fact, it‚Äôs not easy to get a copy as it‚Äôs not available for sale new on DVD or download. That should have set off alarm bells, but what the heck, I had to see for myself. I finally had to order a used DVD copy on Amazon. Big mistake~

What can I say other than, ‚ÄúOh the humanity!‚Äù I‚Äôm fully aware that a TV miniseries does not have access to the same budget resources, A-list actors, top-notch special effects, and artistic talent. But what a disaster this was. Within a few minutes I knew I was along for a long and painful ride. Every frame is amateurish, the amount of inept fight scenes and obvious blue-screen work made me suppress chuckles, but that was only topped by the hopelessly wooden acting of a cast of unknowns expect for William Hurt, who must have deliberately toned it down not to make the others feel bad.

The entire production is clumsy through-and-through, and the only redeeming feature is that the costumes in the film are SO OUTLANDISH that they provide entertainment of a different sort. For example, the stillsuits of the Fremen, which looked believable in the Lynch film, have become flimsy green-camouflaged rain jackets found in the discount bin:



And the Fremen themselves are just low-rate extras from a different back-lot set filming Middle-Eastern marketplace scenes. Even more gut-busting were the blatant samurai armor rip-offs that passed for Harkonnen soldiers‚Äô armor:



If that wasn‚Äôt enough, the Imperial Sardaukar storm troopers, supposedly the most lethal and feared fighters in the galaxy, had silly black headgear like this:



Finally, I had to save a special place for the ridiculous outfits of the Guild Navigators‚Äô representatives:



It‚Äôs easy to ridicule film-making this bad, but I have to give credit for one thing. One of the fatal flaws of Lynch‚Äôs Dune was that it tried to cram an incredibly-complex SF epic into just 2 hours+ of film (unwillingly, I know). So anyone familiar with the book could lament the wholesale destruction of the plot to force the story into that timeframe. It‚Äôs no surprise that most critics and viewers unfamiliar with the book were completely lost. Well, the mini-series does put back in dozens of story arcs to make it much more faithful to the book, and that was appreciated. It‚Äôs easier to recognize the source material in this version, but the poor production and acting quickly torpedo this.

In fact, the miniseries essentially re-shoots almost the entire Lynch film, scene by scene, in an attempt to do it ‚Äòbetter‚Äô. There are hardly any scenes left untouched, but I couldn‚Äôt help thinking I preferred the actors and cinematography of the Lynch film in almost every case. I can imagine the producers pitching this project as ‚Äúlet‚Äôs do Dune again, and get it right this time.‚Äù Well, I second those feelings, but this was not it, not by a long shot.

Judging from the recent prominence of big-budget cable TV productions like Game of Thrones, Man in the High Castle, the 300, the Expanse, and the vast improvement in special effects, it strikes me that Dune is ripe for another adaptation, and could easily fill several quality seasons in the right hands. Imagine the creative team of GOT getting behind this project ‚Äì it could be amazing. Because Dune the book has yet to be done justice, so there‚Äôs a great opportunity here for a skilled team. Any takers?

I won‚Äôt touch my review from October 2021, which is the first time I read this. I will say that the second reading has seen Dune go up to 5 stars. I delved into the appendixes carefully, taking out much more than I could have with a simple reading of the text. I was also a constant fan of Princess Irulan‚Äôs words at the beginning of each chapter, with her ‚Äúliterary aspirations‚Äù.

-----------------------------------
[October 2021]

I think I fall into a different ‚Äústream‚Äù of reading when I am engaged with fantasy or sci fi. Literary fiction, the classics, etc. force you to stop, look around, interact with all of the elements of the story. Often, they are not even about the story ‚Äì as I am so fond of pointing it repeatedly. With fantasy and with sci fi, I fall into the story hole. I am interested in the next action scene and the next character interaction, often not stopping to take a look at my surroundings. As a result, I find that I sometimes derive more pure, instantaneous pleasure from these genres than the classics; on the other hand, I feel that I am unable to read them nearly as close as I would ideally want to.

has the privilege of being a sci fi a classic ‚Äì it‚Äôs a book that I have grappled with for most of my life. I was always able to read similar stories, no matter my age or maturity. The first page of this book, however, always defeated me. Frank Herbert artfully (and cruelly) tosses you into the deep end. As a relatively inexperienced reader of sci fi, seeing these words all on the same page would always cause a mini heart attack: Bene Gesserit, Muad‚ÄôDib, Shaddam, Arrakis, Caladan, Irulan, Atreides. What the hell does it all mean? There is no linear introduction, no ‚Äúinfo dump‚Äù, nothing to catch you up. Suddenly you are waking up with Paul Atreides, ready to meet up with the old crone, ready to put your hand into the , whatever the hell that is. My friend gave me my own copy of this book in 2019 as a Christmas gift ‚Äì beautifully orange, and luckily (despite what shows up here on Goodreads) without the ‚ÄúSoon to be a Major Motion Picture‚Äù. The plan was for me to read the book before the 2020 release of the movie. That got pushed and so did my plans. This month, I knew I had about 15 days to finish the book ‚Äì I am seeing the movie this Thursday. Well, I am done. And it was done relatively quickly.

It‚Äôs a bit of an understatement to say that the reading of the book was made much easier by the fact that I can speak/read Persian. I found myself rarely having to refer to the ‚ÄúTerminology of the Imperium‚Äù section included in the back of the book ‚Äì a neat and extensive dictionary of the words used around the story, often by the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen. This gave the world a bit more gravity, allowing me to buy in. Of course, one of main terms, , is a title given to the Persian poet Hafez. I was walking through familiar territory.

As for the story itself, it was gripping. I could recognize its influence on modern day sci fi and fantasy (e.g., Star Wars, Game of Thrones, etc.), but found it sufficiently deep in its own right. The world of is very intricate. Maybe Herbert was not as in-depth as a Tolkien, but is anyone ever really as in-depth as Tolkien? I found myself constantly anticipating the approach of the worms ‚Äì I could sense a rumble, a slow build-up, a storm of noise, all coming to a head as this otherworldly freight train barreled through the sand. The characters were believable enough, human enough, though slightly over the top at times. I mean, come on, the Harkonnens were pantomime villains if I had ever read any. Apart from that, I found the motivation of the other characters relatable. No flaws there. Did they act like blatant fools at times? Absolutely. But again, we all do at times, don‚Äôt we?

A book rich with ideas, philosophy, and quotes that can be savored every day. I would benefit from another read through of the series in a few years, coming back to it while knowing the story, not trying to situate myself constantly. A good stand-alone book, but I am looking forward to seeing how the universe of will expand over the next 5 books.

There are so many reasons I shouldn‚Äôt love this book. The characters often feel distant. The prose style, while technically competent, can be stuffy and is not always engaging. There are long stretches where it feels like the plot is moving forward at a snail‚Äôs pace. Made-up words are hurled at the reader at every turn. And, considering the 1965 publication date, there are certain elements like gender dynamics which simply didn‚Äôt age well and had me rolling my eyes from time to time.

And yet.

For whatever reason (or combination of reasons), I love this book. Love it wholeheartedly and absolutely. There is something that just feels so brilliant, so awe-inspiring, that instilled in me a sense of wonder I haven‚Äôt felt in years. Worldbuilding has always come secondary to me, as I prefer to focus more on characters and story, but this is the first time I can recall an actual being so impressive to me.

I became obsessed with . When I wasn‚Äôt reading it, I was thinking about it, daydreaming about the harsh world of Arrakis. Even though I‚Äôd already purchased the ebook version and was 60% through, I still spent another $30 on the beautiful deluxe hardcover, and began rereading it from the beginning.

Why? Because I could tell this novel was something special for me. I knew it was something I wanted to cherish in my physical book collection, something I could perhaps revisit.

I am so happy to have discovered this wondrous world. Despite the warnings of many trusted GR friends, I plan to dive headfirst into the rest of the series. I just can‚Äôt help myself.

So what is it that made me love this so much? I‚Äôm really not sure. It could be the age-old feeling of epic storytelling, filled with prophecy and heroic archetypes. It could be the underlying philosophy and thematic resonance, layers upon layers that touch upon things like politics, economics, ecology, and more. And despite not really liking many of the characters (including Paul, who I'm not convinced we are even to like), there were some who I really grew to care about... Jessica, Chani, Gurney, Hawat, and even Alia**! And particularly near the end of the book, there were a few emotionally-stirring moments.

Or maybe it was the sandworms.

I guess I'm one of the few that bridge the gap between the Pride and Prejudice camp and the Dune camp. I loved both.

Dune isn't a light, enjoyable read. At times it reads more like excerpts from geology, ecology, zoology, sociology, pscyhology, and political textbooks. The characters are more like mega-archetypes than real human beings.

The appeal of Dune is peculiar. In order to enjoy Dune you have to enjoy complexity. All authors create little worlds in their stories but Herbert created a .

He doesn't just say that Arrakis is a desert planet, he engrosses himself and the reader into the geology.

He puts people on the planet, governments, conflicting cultures, conflicting religions, conflicting ways of life that are thought out to the Nth level above and beyond anything else I've ever read. You could write a sociology or politics dissertation on the societal relations Herbert conceived for Dune.

Now is complexity itself a thing to be admired in a work of fiction? Generally no, but Dune is so immense and so detailed that it creates and inhabits a category of its own. The very fact that it often reads more like a National Geographic article than a sci-fi novel speaks to its peculiar charm.

Admittedly, this will not appeal to everyone. In fact, odds are that it will appeal to hardly anyone. But limited appeal should in no way factor into a work's quality. Compare the Academy Award-winning films against the yearly box office numbers if you don't agree. I'm sure Armaggeddon outgrossed Monster's Ball.

And amidst all this complexity lies a kind of new myth that blends mysticism, religion, and crass real-world politics. It's a hybrid; it's not The Odyssey and it's certainly not Star Wars but I do find great appeal in its particular take on Campbell's hero's journey. And the fact that it plumbs the intricacies of Muslim/Arab/desert culture adds another layer of exotic flair to the work.

As if all that wasn't ambitious enough, it even articulates a fascinatingly dark but pragmatic destiny for humanity as a whole.

And all of these incredibly ambitious elements are all tightly woven together. Take out one element and the story loses its cohesion. Despite all the ridiculous amounts of detail there is nothing extraneous in this novel.

Dune is a remarkable, magnificent accomplishment. But it's okay if it's not to your taste.

Dune came out in 1965, but it might have been yesterday. Indeed, this book just doesn‚Äôt seem to age at all! This is mainly due to the fact that by eradicating all form of computerized technology from his story, Frank Herbert managed with great talent to render it timeless while simultaneously anchoring it to the foundation of the Science Fiction genre. So many SF books written in the 60‚Äôs, 70‚Äôs, 80‚Äôs, and 90‚Äôs come across as dated simply because the pseudo-technologies that then were amazing to the readers now seem downright ridiculous and even laughable. Not so with Dune. Dune is here to stay. Add to this an amazing world-building, well-crafted characters and unforgettable villains, a twisting plot tackling among other things some still-very-up-to-date-and-even-more-so-nowadays environmental issues, deep-but-very-accessible gems of philosophy dispatched here and there within the text and at the beginning of each chapter, and you have here one of the most successful and influential piece of Science Fiction literature of all time. And deservedly so.

Filled with politics and religion, and the politics of religion, Dune follows House Atreides' new rule over the spice-drug producing planet of Arrakis.

Whispers begin to spread of the legend of an off-world prophet that was long ago chiseled into the minds of a people. And the people have a mind of their own.

High up in the clouds ringing the Science Fiction Olympus, at the very peak of the mountain of the writing gods, sits Frank Herbert, seated on a throne of crisp, first-edition copies of Dune, a golden, sandworm-shaped staff in his right hand.

Herbert is an SF deity, and his elevation to godhood comes from one book, and one book alone. Sure he wrote a bunch of other novels, several of which continue the story started in , and several of which are interesting reads. None of them, however, equalled the impact of his most famous work, and the book his name has become synonymous with.

is central to science fiction. You can't call yourself an SF fan if you haven't read it, or at least attempted to do so.

This is an epic novel, one of the true classics of the genre along with books like , . , and .

Herbert introduces readers to an interstellar empire founded on Melange - also known as Spice - an addictive substance that profoundly alters its users, allowing them to fold spacetime and travel vast distances instantaneously, a substance found only on the planet Arrakis. He shows us two noble families competing for the favour of their emperor and the control of the harvesting of this substance. In the great deserts of Arrakis he brings us to gigantic sandworms that hunt via the vibrations of footsteps. Finally we meet the Fremen of the arid wastes who survive wearing stillsuits that recycle their sweat, their urine, even the moisture they exhale.

All of this exists in a deep and convincing future that is utterly computer-less, the result of an AI-led war centuries prior that has seen thinking machines of any type destroyed without mercy wherever they are found. In this future the work of AIs is done by hyper-enhanced and trained humans called mentats, who serve where computers once did.

Into this strange world comes Paul Atreides, a young heir to a noble house, betrayed and marooned in the desert, but destined to change entirely the universe in which he has grown up. His story is a big one, and it will stick with you.

It's all heady, imagination-firing stuff, and just thinking about it thrills me with the limitless potential of the SF genre.

's influence is incalculable. references to it turn up in every medium, from the intelligence enhancing 'mentats' tablets in the games, through to worm sign in and a whole load of setting and characters in . It looms in the subconscious of anyone writing in this genre, whether they are aware of it or not.

The reputation of this book is well earned. It‚Äôs a damn fine story, and an astonishing feat of imagination. Read it. You‚Äôll probably love it, and even if you don‚Äôt you‚Äôll learn a lot about SF and the major influences in the genre.

"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer."

Another buddy read with the awesomest of friends, TS, Emma and Celeste, is done!

Turns out we need not have rushed to read this one before the movie, but in hindsight, this writing was on the wall. As for the story, I went into this not expecting to enjoy it much, and I was pleasantly surprised, at least for a while.

Dune is of course, much loved and very well known as a staple of the science fiction genre and reading this for the first time I can very much see why. The story turned about to be a bit of a page turner, up to a point, filled with themes of power, control, religion, politics and family, all wrapped up in a intriguing promised one type plot with some excellent world-building and fascinating characters. And while I can easily say that Dune has stood the test of time and I am happy to have read it, my excitement for the story got lost a bit in all the philosophy and the weirder moments in the book, and lastly the ending which left quite a bit to be desired. All in all a very enjoyable read though.

There's so much great science fiction writing out there now that you forget that it used to be a looked down upon stepchild of "serious literature". Frank Herbert was one of the authors who caused this evolution of science fiction from "the natural child of someone" to great art in and of itself.

A great story well told, Dune has a few tiny discomforts for the modern reader; such as the slight misogyny of the sisterhood of the Bene Gesserit witches and Paul's contemptuous treatment of his mother in the desert. One of the signs to look for in any work for the treatment of women is are they concerned with more than just their sons and husbands and do they have power.

In this, Herbert is guilty of the first, Lady Jessica, not even the wife of her royal husband, but his concubine, is mostly concerned with son and husband. For the second part though, she does have immense power and can use the power of her voice to control men. She and Paul, her son and future leader, take an impromptu trip through the harsh desert and come upon the fremen who have made a rich life in the barren terrain. This voyage is one of the strongest parts of the story and shows Lady Jessica as a powerful figure herself. The dynamic push and pull between mother and son prefigures the trap that Paul may fall into as he becomes a messianic leader.

Impressive, epic, creative, revolutionary, classic, not for me. The sort of politics-heavy, languidly-paced, intellectually-stimulating beast that my mind respects more than my emotions connect with.

I don't know what it is about this book in particular that I never clicked with because I've loved other dense, cerebral, worldbuilding sci-fi books that are similar thematically, and this is sort of the granddaddy of them all. I think part of it is that I never became fully invested in the characters. I also felt like I was working too hard for it to be the transportive, escapist masterpiece I was expecting.

During much of the middle I would frequently find myself thinking "I'd rather just watch the movie condensed to only the best bits than spend so much time here." I realize that's blasphemy to most book enthusiasts, and fans of this book in particular. Whoops. But let me tell you, I am about the new movie adaptation coming out later this year! I think director Denis Villneuve (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049) is a so providing the screenwriters (including Eric Roth of Forrest Gump and Benjamin Button) get it right and it's edited tightly, it has the potential to be the Dune I've been hoping for.

Some books give so much more on a reread.
This time I had no problems with the pacing. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this is not a page-turner, this book is to be savored in a leisurely manner, one glorious set-piece after the other. I had no problem with Chani romance this time, there‚Äôs something precious and beautiful in a love story that has no start, making it a love without borders of time. And I just tend to enjoy the melancholy mood of the piece, the tragedy of great noble people failing, the tragic fate of Paul‚Äôs leadership and zealotry of the people whose actions become his responsibility. This is a beautiful book full of pathos with a meh ending, but what can you do? Satisfying endings are hard, and it's not like this is the real ending of this story.

And no, I haven‚Äôt seen the movie.



This book is an ancient greek epic written by Homer but in space.

First few hundred pages are a bit dense and a lot of people I know stopped reading in the beginning. But if you keep going, you‚Äôll find a unique and epic world. I see where Stargate, Star Wars, Avatar and even Tremors got inspirations. A lot of politics, religion and even magic.

It‚Äôs a plot or maybe even idea driven story. Characters are not very complex. And I don‚Äôt know if I caught everything on the first reading. We have a lot of inner monologues and all big battles happened behind the scenes.
I‚Äôve read the whole book and I cannot tell you what Paul's personality is except he is a chosen one(in this book at least). Lady Jessica is a ninja and spiritual leader and the best character. Baron did not age well (he is the most evil disgusting fat guy who cannot even stand by himself and also only homosexual and rapist. yikes) Great love of Paul and Chani came to be because they foresaw their love. And then it happened between chapters. And I really disliked Chani. There was nothing to her. I hope in the movie they‚Äôll give her a personality.
But I loved Arrakis. And I want to see it on a big screen.

Dios cre√≥ Arrakis para probar a los fieles

Esta obra maestra de Frank Herbert es una de las mejores novelas de ciencia ficci√≥n de todos los tiempos, ha sido ganadora de los premios Nebula en 1965 y Hugo en 1966.

Hab√≠a pospuesto Dune por demasiado tiempo, por fin me atrev√≠ a leerlo despu√©s de casi 10 a√±os. Herbert llev√≥ el feudalismo a niveles gal√°cticos, cre√≥ un universo con un poderoso marco cultural, pol√≠tico y econ√≥mico con un nivel de detalle impresionante.

El Imperio, el Landsraad, la CHOAM, la Cofrad√≠a Espacial, la Bene Gesserit con su Missionaria Protectiva, los Fremen, la especia, los gusanos de arena .... ¬°Dune!

I did buy the new and beautifull edition celebrating its original publishing in 1965 and expected movie this year, which was the one movie I was really looking forward this year and with Covid-19 being the factor that stopped this party I decided to reread this novel once more.

As a fifteen old kid who kept annoying the ladies of my local library with my great thirst for reading books they had decided to offer me some books to keep me busy. First of was Lord of the Rings by one Tolkien which got devoured with a speed they considered somewhat unsettling they then gave me this book Dune a scifi book. With my scifi taste being mostly Star Trek and Star Wars this book was of course an eye opener and something of new territory for a young kid. For I while I read quite a lot of scifi, classics and whatnot but Dune and its sequels always remained special.
I did read the three sequels, Messiah, Children and God Emperor and was and am still today totally in awe of these books. When I discovered the next two Frank Herbert books I put one on my reading list for English and my teacher who turned out to be a fan too disputed that books existence. Until I put it on his desk and he decided that afternoon to visit the bookstore to obtain a copy and during my oral exam we did discuss this book and I am sure I learned a lot of insight from this English teacher more than he learned from his student. But this teacher loved students that read and came up with different choices than the average student who read because they must.

Anyhow this phenomenal Scifi book tells a story about a duke and his family whom get displaced from their own watery world to a desert world where the article Spice is being found and its application is considered to be a boon to health, prescience and is actually very important in Spaceflight by the Guild navigators. It is difficult to not slip into information later learned in the sequels Messiah & Children because they feel actually not like book 2 & 3 but part of the original tale of Dune.
Paul Atreides loses his father to the treacherous Harkonnen on the planet Arrakis also know as Dune. He becomes the leader of the desert people that inhabit the planet and leads them on a path to religious Jihad and throw the other houses of the Landsraad and the Emperor aside.
This sounds like a lot of action but most of the story is weaving a new world and its secrets and culture. There is so much to be enjoyed in Frank Herberts creation and often you are left in some bewilderment how one man could make up so much different cultures of humanity and there is not an alien around.
My advise would be to read the three books that make up the story of the Atreides and the genetic line they represent and the duty they have for the Universe.
Recognize the prescience that leaves Paul Atreides some choices and he is definitely afraid of his choices and the future he will create. This story tells about a special young man who is meant to change the universe and yet is terribly afraid for the future he will create and yet must do so or die and leave the universe in danger for the future.
The story represents some Greek tragedy which admittingly was also some of Frank Herberts source/inspiration, the foreword by Brian Herbert who went on to enlarge his fathers Duniverse does give you some insight in his fathers writing and thinking.
For me the Bene Gesserit have always been the most fascinating of creations and considering their role in the Duniverse they were important too for Frank Herbert. It is their part in the story that gets everything rolling.

This particular copy is absolutely beautiful and one might hope that the next two installments also get the same treatment with a new release as there is plenty of time and need before we get to see the movie next year. They actually deserve the same respect as they are one story and it would look amazing on my bookshelves of course.

4.5 Complex and incredibly well crafted: Dune. Slow introduction, heavy politics, long descriptions, clever dialogue, smart exposition, critical to the world. A classic. An obvious inspiration for so many to come, with a fascinating fictional science. The author takes his time for everything, and because of that, the ending is brilliant. You got to be patient, Dune delivers.

Relectura: No recordaba mucho de lo que pasaba y creo que en esta ocasi√≥n pude apreciar la historia mejor, adem√°s de dejarme ahora si con ganas de leer la continuaci√≥n. Prest√°ndole atenci√≥n es obvio en donde estaba el inter√©s del autor, hay paginas enteras de dialogo interno de los personajes, descripciones largas y detalladas de lugares y en cambio el desenlace ocurre en apenas unas 30 p√°ginas. Y aun hay algo que me separa de la historia, sigo sin saber que es. Pero la recomendaci√≥n sigue, A continuaci√≥n mi rese√±a original recortada porque estaba demasiado larga.



Los ap√©ndices es lo que marca la diferencia entre un gran libro y una obra.

No saben lo mucho que me gusta leer una historia que se sienta como un trabajo hecho a conciencia. Es una lectura tan completa que algo en el picara tu curiosidad.

La trama vista de manera general puede que sea sencilla, pero a detalle se vuelve casi inabarcable. La introducci√≥n es enorme, el universo creado muy basto y las subtramas, que incluyen mucha filosof√≠a sobre religi√≥n, liderazgo, sociedad y ecolog√≠a, muy directas. El dialogo entre personajes es muy inteligente, y lo menciono por que un dialogo flojo a mi muy particularmente me puede arruinar un libro.

En general es un trabajo muy bien logrado. Si hay o no simbolismos a acciones de nuestro pasado o referencias a nuestras religiones ya depender√° de ti y de que tanta atenci√≥n le prestes. Pero en su forma m√°s ligera;

Al inicio de cada cap√≠tulo hay extractos y referencias a libros del mismo mundo de ficci√≥n, algunos sirven bastante pero otros te spoilean todo el condenado capitulo. ¬°¬øComo porque rayos?!

Dios cre√≥ Arrakis para probar a los fieles.

Por fin he terminado la primera novela de la saga Dune, un cl√°sico de la cifi, cuyo libro llevaba esperando m√°s de un a√±o en mi estanter√≠a. Menos mal que lo compagin√© con el audiolibro, este mastodonte no lo habr√≠a le√≠do tan r√°pido con lo poco que estoy leyendo este 2021.

¬øQu√© puedo decir que no se haya dicho ya? Me encant√≥ la pel√≠cula y ha sido muy fiel al libro, aunque no lo incluyen todo. Me ha flipado la creaci√≥n del mundo y la cantidad de detalle que hay a lo largo de la narraci√≥n. El autor le ha dado vida a un universo muy rico y complejo y ha sido lo que m√°s he disfrutado de la novela. Tambi√©n me ha encantado toda la carga pol√≠tica, religiosa y de intriga de la novela: traiciones, intrigas pol√≠ticas dentro de m√°s intrigas, c√≥mo funcionan las casas... Ha sido impresionate.

No tengo m√°s que decir, ha sido una novela soberbia y ahora entiendo el amor que se le tiene y me uno a el. Sin duda seguir√© con la saga en alg√∫n momento porque el final tambi√©n te deja con esas ganas de continuar con la historia.

"Dune" is a cultural keystone, so I had to read it. But I don't have to like it.

1 star. I do not care if it can be read as a futuristic reimagining of the Book of Exodus, or if it informed the zeitgeist of early Nerd Culture. This book is boring. Even the action scenes are boring. Even the cool and interesting parts of the setting are boring. Frank Herbert sure could imagine a detailed, internally consistent, unique and symbolic world, and having read his work will certainly help me answer a few questions at trivia night. But he can't hold my attention for beans.

Ok, so, this was good, but it wasn‚Äôt amazing necessarily looking at it from a more modern lens, but I certainly respect it a lot for what it has done for the genre. My rating is really 3.5 stars, it‚Äôs just above a three, but also not quite a four, but ya know, Goodreads doesn‚Äôt have half stars, so I‚Äôve just rounded it up to a four. Just as a note, I haven‚Äôt read a huge number of sci-fi novels, especially more classic sci-fi, like this novel is, so I don‚Äôt have a lot of older works to compare my review of Dune with, and everything is just my opinion here, as reviews as subjective.

For the characters, I found them to be alright. They weren‚Äôt the most amazing, but nor were they horrible and there were certainly some really nice moments between them. Compared to some of the stuff by more modern authors, I would have preferred for them to have stronger voices and more to separate them between each other. Some of the characters felt like they were sort of just there to advance the plot, or have the character go in a certain direction. I was sort of surprised at how much of the book, especially in the first half that spent a lot of time following Jessica, but I was fine with that as she was an interesting character, though she did become a lot less relevant in the third part. Paul was fine, he‚Äôs essentially the chosen one and it played out in an interesting, though not amazing way.

The world was really nice, as I expected. One thing about Dune that I have heard is at how groundbreaking the world was for its time and what it did for sci-fi, much like LOTR did for fantasy. I certainly agree with that and especially for its time, would have been amazing. There definitely was a lot of depth to the world, and it was a pretty complex, with a chunky appendix at the end that really built up it well. The book is largely spent on the planet of Arrakis, which was interesting in how the world worked and functioned, and the Fremen were fascinating to read about. In my view, the world was probably the strongest element of the world for me. Compared to some of the stuff that I‚Äôve read in the fantasy genre(I know this is sci-fi), it doesn‚Äôt stand out as much, though it certainly is still good. There were also some more fantastical elements that I wasn‚Äôt aware was in it before I started reading it, as I initially though it was hard sci-fi, when in reality, it is more sci-fantasy, which was cool.

I don‚Äôt know if I would say if I really vibe with the writing style. For the most part it was fine, though there were a few things that sort of pulled me out from being immersed all the time. I don‚Äôt know if I liked at how, while yes, it‚Äôs told in third person, the actual point of view kept switching every few paragraphs sometimes so that we followed the thought process of different people and that was just jarring to me. There was also the whole a-h-h-h, or wel-l-l-l in dialogue, that sort of bothered me because you just never see it done anymore and it‚Äôs less a critique of his writing, but rather just that I could not get accustomed to it. There were also lots of character thought written all in italics, and for some reason that managed to take me out of being fully immersed in the text.

The plot was decent, if not somewhat predictable in many of the events. We do spend some time following the antagonists in the story, so that gives us a bit of view of sort of where the plot is going. I would like to think that for its time, where plots weren‚Äôt always super strong, it would have been really good for sure. I enjoyed the ending of this and clearly leaves a lot of stuff for the story to move ahead in for the rest of the series. It wasn‚Äôt brilliant of an ending, but it was still good, if that makes sense. I honestly at this point don‚Äôt know if I will continue with the series, as I have heard mixed things about the sequels. Either way, this book wrapped up nicely by itself, so I don‚Äôt really have too much of an urge to read on.

One area in the plot that I didn‚Äôt love was the significant time jump between Parts 2 and 3, where I think two-three years pass in a blink of an eye. The author also doesn‚Äôt tell you this and you do have to figure it yourself, which look, was fine, I had no problem with that. My main issue with the time jump is that a fair number of significant events occur during that time frame, including some important things for the main characters. Now, when we hear of these things or when events occur, as the reader, I didn‚Äôt really feel any sort of connection to some events in Part 3 that were important to the characters, but I just couldn‚Äôt care much about it. Maybe smaller and gradual time jumps would have helped, considering this occurs two thirds through the book as the sudden jump was jarring. I‚Äôm perfectly fine with time jumps at the start of books, or between books, but near the end was sort of just weird for me personally. I have seen this in Feist‚Äôs , so maybe it was more common in classic works, I don‚Äôt know.

I would say that it has aged fairly well, mostly because of the really solid worldbuilding that holds up really well and that enough time is spent making the main characters to be somewhat interesting. It also does draw on other cultures and in not just centred on Western cultures which, sadly, wasn‚Äôt done back in the 1960s. This has changed greatly now, for which I am super glad about with way more BIPOC authors being published, which is fantastic. I would imagine that in the Western world at least, this would have been revolutionary.

So overall, I thought that this was good, but I suppose it failed to blow me away. I respect it for what it has achieved and how much of an influence it has had on the sci-fi genre, but respect does not always equal enjoyment or love for something. 7/10

I know a lot of people love this book and I can understand why especially after reading the reviews. I personally didn't enjoy it very much though. It felt like it took me at least 300 pages to really get into the story. The book felt very long and I felt like I had to keep redirecting my attention back to reading because I wasn't feeling engaged. Part of it might be because it took me a while to get used to the new words being thrown around and at first I had trouble keep track of the characters. Also the way the Fremen were clearly inspired by Bedouins and Islam just kept distracting me. I did start enjoying it much more once I got halfway through it, probably because the action felt like it picked up. I don't think I'll be reading the other books in the series though.

Upuƒáenost o nadahnuƒáu, motivima, a pogotovo o uticaju na pregr≈°t pisaca nauƒçne fantastike je ne≈°to ≈°to vol≈°ebno delo poput Herbertove Dine insistira, pre dono≈°enja konaƒçne presude ostvarenju, bilo kakva da je ona.

Dune is a beautiful and complex fiction masterpiece. Frank Herbert built up an incredibly vivid world, layer upon layer, with multiple religious/belief systems, strongly developed cultures which clashed with each other and a thousand currents of political manoeuvring, from the lowest classes up to the emperor himself.

It took a very long time for this novel to reach any action, but I didn‚Äôt mind one bit, because I enjoyed really getting to know each character and exploring their universe. I found there wasn‚Äôt a single character I wasn‚Äôt invested in, or at least interested in. Paul, Jessica and Alia were particularly my favourites, especially with their Bene Gesserit insights/training. I must say, I really, thoroughly enjoyed the clever use of the giant desert worms in this novel.

My only disappointment was the ending, not the way it ended, but the way it was told. I felt it was too rushed, there was too much telling and not enough showing, and the scene unfolding cut off before completion. I would have liked to see all the threads neatly tied up, but I guess these will be picked up in the next book.

Quer√≠a leer este libro desde hac√≠a mucho tiempo y con el estreno de la nueva adaptaci√≥n, con m√°s raz√≥n. Mikey Fern√°ndez organiz√≥ una lectura conjunta para estos d√≠as y aprovech√© la ocasi√≥n, aunque esta vez no he participado mucho en el Discord comentando el libro porque algunos d√≠as qued√© rezagada con el calendario propuesto. Sin embargo, la √∫ltima parte del libro la devor√© y lo termin√© antes de tiempo.

Los primeros tres cap√≠tulos me resultaron un poco abrumadores, con mucha informaci√≥n y conceptos, y me asust√© un poco, pero a partir de ah√≠ va todo rodado. Me dej√© llevar y me familiaric√© pronto con la ambientaci√≥n, la historia y los personajes. No me ha parecido para nada un libro complejo ni lento, de hecho es muy entretenido y las p√°ginas vuelan, aunque van quedando cosillas en el aire que piensas que se resolver√°n m√°s tarde pero no es as√≠. ¬øYa ten√≠a en mente Frank Herbert hacer una saga cuando escribi√≥ este libro? No lo s√©.

Est√° llenito de conspiraciones pol√≠ticas y esos momentos los disfrut√© mucho. Tambi√©n tiene mucha importancia la filosof√≠a, el ecologismo (aqu√≠ se nota lo fan que Herbert era de H.G. Wells), la religi√≥n (de hecho la figura del protagonista me ha parecido similar a la de Mahoma), y se percibe claramente la inspiraci√≥n en algunas tribus originarias de Pr√≥ximo Oriente para crear a la poblaci√≥n de Arrakis, el planeta donde transcurre el libro. Tambi√©n se plasman costumbres medievales y es evidente, en general, el gran legado que ‚ÄúDune‚Äù dej√≥ a la fantas√≠a y la ciencia ficci√≥n; he visto muchos recursos que han sido utilizados por otros autores posteriormente, como por ejemplo George R.R. Martin.

Sin duda una de las cosas que m√°s he disfrutado ha sido la construcci√≥n de mundo; la ambientaci√≥n tambi√©n, me atrap√≥ por completo. ‚ÄúDune‚Äù tiene momentos muy potentes y √©picos, algunos un tanto psicod√©licos (que se note que el libro fue escrito en los 60). Tambi√©n me ha gustado y me ha sorprendido la cantidad de personajes femeninos interesantes que hay, teniendo en cuenta la √©poca en la que se escribi√≥. Sin duda, Jessica o Alia han sido de mis personajes favoritos del libro; una pena sin embargo Chani, que promet√≠a mucho y queda completamente desdibujada. El villano, el bar√≥n Vladimir Harkonnen, tambi√©n me ha gustado mucho, disfrut√© sus conspiraciones y su patetismo con fervor. Los ap√©ndices que se incluyen son muy interesantes, aportan datos muy esclarecedores sobre diversas cuestiones, tanto relativas a la trama como a Arrakis.

En el punto negativo, el final me dio la sensaci√≥n de que se precipitaba un poco y no me habr√≠a importado que tuviera m√°s p√°ginas, porque algunas soluciones me parecieron bruscas y apa√±adas en √∫ltimo momento. Me ocurre igual con algunos saltos temporales, algunos me gustaron, pero en otros habr√≠a sido genial ver algo m√°s de desarrollo. A veces me daba la impresi√≥n de que el autor ten√≠a prisa o pereza para esmerarse en ciertas cosas.

El desenlace es casi ambiguo, abierto y al mismo tiempo no; se puede considerar la historia cerrada en cierto modo, pero para los muy curiosos (como yo) continuar con la saga es una necesidad obvia, porque en ‚ÄúDune‚Äù se dan respuestas, pero tambi√©n quedan muchos interrogantes.

Dune, fikrimin ince g√ºl√º, √ß√∂l baharƒ±m... Sana yine de ele≈ütiriler hazƒ±rladƒ±m :) √á√ºnk√º hatasƒ±z kul olmaz.

Bu eseri √∂vmek i√ßin s√∂yleyebileceƒüim sayfalarca ≈üey var ve bunlarƒ±n hepsi zaten s√∂ylenmi≈ü. O nedenle kitabƒ± okuduƒüum s√ºre boyunca kalbimi s√∂kercesine fetheden √º√ß ≈üeyden bahsedip ele≈ütirilerime ge√ßmek istiyorum.

1. Kitabƒ± okumaya ba≈ülamadan √∂nce her defasƒ±nda bol bol su i√ßip hazƒ±rlanmama neden oldu. Ve bu hi√ßbir i≈üe yaramadƒ±. Frank Herbest √ß√∂l gezegenini √∂yle bir anlatƒ±yor ki, kitabƒ±n ba≈üƒ±na oturduƒüum her seferde birden kendimi susuzlukla ba≈ü ederken buldum. Lavaboya gitmeyi erteledim, ne oluyorsa artƒ±k. V√ºcudumdaki suyu olabildiƒüince tutmaya √ßalƒ±≈ütƒ±ƒüƒ±m bir Fremen taklidine d√∂n√º≈üt√ºm.
Kitaba dair en unutulmaz ≈üeylerden biri kesinlikle suyun deƒüerinin okuma seyrim boyunca aldƒ±ƒüƒ± ≈üekildi. ƒ∞nanƒ±lmaz bir anlatƒ±m.
2. Orta Doƒüu k√ºlt√ºr√ºn√º tarafsƒ±z bir Amerikalƒ±'dan okumaktan dolayƒ± mutluyum. ƒ∞slamofobinin Herbert'ƒ±n zihninde egemen olmamasƒ±, onun tarafsƒ±z bakƒ±≈ü a√ßƒ±sƒ±yla bu kadar ba≈üarƒ±lƒ± ele alƒ±≈üƒ±nda b√ºy√ºk bir katkƒ±. Eƒüer yazar bir Orta Doƒüulu olsaydƒ± benim i√ßin iki tehlike ba≈ü g√∂stercekti: Yazar, √ßok sƒ±kƒ±ntƒ±lƒ± bulduƒüum bazƒ± konularƒ± g√ºzelleyerek beni itebilirdi. Ya da yazar, kendi k√ºlt√ºr√ºne duyduƒüu nefretle itici bir hava sergileyebilirdi. Ama elimizde hepsinden iyisi var: Dƒ±≈üarƒ±dan bakan, tarafsƒ±z, √ºstelik efsanevi bir yazar.
3. O nasƒ±l bir k√ºlt√ºr in≈üasƒ±, o nasƒ±l sosyolojik dengeler b√ºt√ºn√º? Bene Gesseritler'in her bir ≈üeyine a≈üƒ±k olmu≈ü olabilirim. Burada s√∂ylenecek √ßok fazla ≈üey var ve bunlarƒ± zaten √ßok yerde okudunuz. √áok kƒ±skandƒ±m, son olarak onu s√∂yleyeyim.

Ama i≈üte, birka√ß ≈üey var ki bu ≈üaheserde g√∂z√ºm√º fena tƒ±rmalƒ±yor.

Bunlardan ilki ve en b√ºy√ºƒü√º kesinlikle karakterlerin i≈üleni≈üi. Frank Herbert'ƒ±n d√ºnya/d√ºnyalar yaratmadaki dehasƒ±nƒ± tartƒ±≈ümak ne haddime, ama kendisinin aynƒ± ba≈üarƒ±sƒ±nƒ± karakter yaratmada g√∂remedim.

Kitabƒ±n karakterlerine hƒ±zlƒ±ca bakalƒ±m. K√∂t√º adamƒ±mƒ±z Baron Harkonnen. Obez, s√ºrekli bir ≈üeyler tƒ±kƒ±≈ütƒ±ran, √ºstelik gen√ß erkeklere tecav√ºz eden sapkƒ±n bir k√∂t√º. Yahu bu bildiƒüin k√∂t√º ≈üi≈üman √ßocuk tiplemesi. Sonra D√ºk Leto. Leto, her iyi ve onurlu adam gibi bir ≈üahini andƒ±ran y√ºz hatlarƒ±na sahip. Onurlu, gururlu, halkƒ± her ≈üeyden √∂nce geliyor. Kalbi altƒ±n gibi ƒ±≈üƒ±ldƒ±yor. Oƒülunun √∂n√ºnde m√ºthi≈ü bir rol model. ƒ∞yi de bu adamalr gittikleri gezegenleri s√∂m√ºren insanlar g√ºn√ºn sonunda. Atreides hanesi de b√ºy√ºk bir hanedan. Ger√ßekten bu adamlar b√∂ylesine halkƒ±n adamƒ± mƒ±? Tipik bir iyi/kahraman baba. Hem de y√ºz hatlarƒ±na kadar.

≈ûu an ikinci kitaptayƒ±m ve sevdiƒüim bir karakter yok. Karakterlere sevgi duyamƒ±yor, onlardan nefret edemiyorum. Harkonnenlar mesela, "eeh" diyerek okuyup ge√ßtiƒüim b√∂l√ºmlere sahipler. √ñfke duymadƒ±m, nefret etmedim.

Herbert'ƒ±n karakterleri, (beni lin√ß etmeyin!) bence karakterden √ßok tipleme seviyesinde kalƒ±yor. Hele ki kitabƒ±n en ba≈ülarƒ±nda.

Paul'un ettiƒüi s√∂zlerde annesinin hemen gurur duymasƒ±, babasƒ±nƒ±n hemen oƒüluyla ilgili hayallere dalmasƒ±... Paul'√º gereksiz y√ºcelten ≈üeyler vardƒ± kitapta. Neyse ki √ß√∂l√ºn derinlerine d√º≈ü√ºnce durumlar deƒüi≈üti.

Fremenler ne zaman ki kitapta aƒüƒ±rlƒ±k kazanƒ±yor, o zaman bu karakter sorunlarƒ± da indirgeniyor. Derinlik ba≈ülƒ±yor ve bunda k√ºlt√ºr√ºn b√ºy√ºk bir katkƒ±sƒ± var. Fremenler sonrasƒ± her ≈üey √ßok daha g√ºzel ve kusursuz.

-- Sevgili Onur Uslu'nun yorumu √ºzerine buraya da eklemek istediƒüim bir detay var --

Dune'un √∂z√ºnde aynƒ± karakterlerle bir seriyi g√∂t√ºrmeyen bir yapƒ±da olduƒüunu da g√∂z √∂n√ºnde bulundurarak karakter ele≈ütirisini yaptƒ±ƒüƒ±mƒ± belirtmem gerek. Burasƒ± ger√ßekten √∂nemli. Bunu yaparken kafamda benzer yapƒ±da olan (hatta her kitapta ba≈üka karakterleri i≈üleyen) Vakƒ±f serisi ile kƒ±yas yaptƒ±m.

Vakƒ±f doƒüasƒ± gereƒüi her kitapta ba≈üka karakterlere ev sahipliƒüi yapar, ama her kitapta da o karakterleri bir ≈üeklde √∂z√ºmseriz. Elbette tek kitaplƒ±k karakterler olmalarƒ± dolayƒ±sƒ±yla herhangi bir roman dizisinde beklenen derinliƒüe ula≈ümayƒ±z, ancak ben Vakƒ±f'ƒ±n karakterlerine "tipleme" diyemem mesela. Ama Baron Harkonnen benim i√ßin maalesef sadece bir tipleme.

Frank Herbert bize √∂zellikle Baron Harkonnen'ƒ± ≈ü√∂yle sunuyor: "Bakƒ±n bu adam obez, s√ºspans√∂rler yardƒ±mƒ±yla ancak y√ºr√ºyor, √ºstelik gen√ß erkeklere y√ºr√ºyor, hatta onlara tecav√ºz dahi ediyor. ≈ûimdi bu adamdan nefret etmenizi istiyorum."
Paul'√ºn bulunduƒüu konumu ve hikayede i≈ülendiƒüi s√ºreyi de ele alarak (evet, vadesini biliyorum :) ) bir Vakƒ±f kar≈üƒ±la≈ütƒ±rmasƒ± daha yapacaƒüƒ±m.

Vakƒ±f'ƒ±n kurucusu Hari Seldon'ƒ± da biz 2 kitapta g√∂r√ºr√ºz mesela (Vakƒ±f Kurulurken ve Vakƒ±f ƒ∞leri). Ama bug√ºn Hari Seldon dediƒüimizde aklƒ±mda bir karakter uyanƒ±r. Paul bir karakter deƒüil mi? Paul √ßok ≈ü√ºk√ºr o √ºst√ºn evlat tiplemesinden √ß√∂le d√º≈ü√ºnce √ßƒ±ktƒ±. Paul'√ºn gelgitleri onu karakter yaptƒ±. Paul'√ºn i√ß √ßeki≈ümeleri, kadere razƒ± olu≈üu, Chani'ye kar≈üƒ± zayƒ±flƒ±ƒüƒ± onu karakter yaptƒ±.

----

Kitaba dair bir ba≈üka ele≈ütirim diyaloglar √ºzerine. Kitabƒ±n ortalarƒ±na kadar bazƒ± diyaloglar √ßok basit ka√ßƒ±yor. O konumdaki biri ger√ßekten b√∂yle bir laf eder mi?, dediƒüim anlar oldu. Bunlarƒ± ilk kitap olmasƒ±na veriyorum. Yarƒ±sƒ±ndan sonra durumlar bir hayli toparladƒ± yine. Mutluyum.

Son ele≈ütirimse yazarƒ±n milyon kez s√∂ylediƒüi ≈üeyleri tekrarlamasƒ±na dair. Bakƒ±n bu diyeceƒüimi yazar 2. kitapta da yapƒ±yor ve sanƒ±rƒ±m diƒüer kitaplarda da yapacak.
Mesela ortamda imalƒ± bir laf ediliyor ya da Paul veya Jessica birinin ger√ßek ruh halini anlƒ±yor. Yazar hemen 1 c√ºmle boyunca bunun Bene Gesserit eƒüitiminden kaynaklandƒ±ƒüƒ±nƒ± anlatƒ±yor.
Frank Ba≈ükan, bir dur Allah'ƒ±nƒ± seversen, zaten ortalƒ±k karƒ±≈üƒ±k. Sen ilk kitapta 700 sayfa bunu g√∂z√ºm√ºze soktun, ikinci kitapta neden hala yapƒ±yorsun? Hatta ikinciye de gelme, ilk kitapta biz anladƒ±k, √∂ƒürendik bunlarƒ±. Ne olur artƒ±k s√ºrekli bunu a√ßƒ±klama, yalvarƒ±yorum :( Hele ki Paul i√ßin bunu a√ßƒ±klamasƒ± daha da feci. Paul ki ... ƒ∞≈üte biliyorsunuz, spoiler yazmayayƒ±m :) Paul gibi birini i√ßin a√ßƒ±klama yapmasƒ± bence ayrƒ±ca gereksiz.

Ama mesela aynƒ± yazar bu bariz ≈üeyleri a√ßƒ±klarken, ba≈üka ≈üeylerde √ßok kapalƒ± olabiliyor.

Ayrƒ±ca, ilk kitap √∂yle bir bitiyor ki sanki kitapta eksik sayfa var. Hawat sahnesi mesela, b√ºy√ºk hayal kƒ±rƒ±klƒ±ƒüƒ± oldu benim i√ßin. √áƒ±ta √ßok y√ºkselmi≈üti, kar≈üƒ±lƒ±ƒüƒ±nƒ± alamadƒ±k.

Kitabƒ±n son b√∂l√ºm√º u√ßarak gidiyor ve en olmamasƒ± gereken b√∂l√ºm belki de. K√ºt diye de bitiyor kitap.

ƒ∞thaki'nin Bilimkurgu Klasikleri dizisinin ilk eseri olarak se√ßilmi≈ü Dune'un daha az yazm hatasƒ±yla kar≈üƒ±ma √ßƒ±kmasƒ±nƒ± iterdim. ƒ∞kinci kitapta da bu durum devam ediyor, onu da eklemi≈ü olayƒ±m. Onun dƒ±≈üƒ±nda √ßeviriyle ya da edit√∂rl√ºkle ilgili hi√ßbir sorunum yok. Ellere saƒülƒ±k.

Dune, okuduƒüum hi√ßbir ≈üeye benzemiyor ve bundan inanƒ±lmaz mutluyum. 65'te yazƒ±lmƒ±≈ü ama bug√ºn bile bu kadar orijinal kalmasƒ± hayret verici. ≈ûaheser, evet, ba≈üka ≈üekilde tanƒ±mlayamƒ±yorum.

Bu kitabƒ±n bir kokusu, bir dokusu ve bir sesi var. G√∂r√ºyorsunuz, tadƒ±yorsunuz, susuyorsunuz, dokunuyorsunuz... Uzaklardan kumsolucanlarƒ±nƒ±n sesi geliyor. Buram buram baharat kokuyor √ºstelik. Be≈ü duyuyla algƒ±lanabilen bir eserde bahsediyoruz.

A few weeks ago when I was trying to decide which book I should read next and starring at my book shelf I set my eyes upon a thick book, with a dark cover. The title read ‚ÄúDUNE‚Äù and above that was written ‚ÄúScience Fiction‚Äôs Supreme Masterpiece‚Äù. Dune had been on my shelf for, I don‚Äôt know, maybe five or six years and I had always lacked the motivation to actually read it whenever I thought of its length. But this time something called my attention, I don‚Äôt know exactly what, maybe it was the golden colour of the sand drawn on the cover or maybe it was the crease on the tip of the cover.

I opened the book and began to read the first page. There was a long quote from the ‚ÄúManual of Muad‚ÄôDib‚Äù on the first half of the page, apparently written ‚Äúby the Princess Irulan‚Äù, and there were words I didn‚Äôt recognise, like Bene Gesserit, Muad‚ÄôDib, Caladan and Arrakis. I kept on reading. A few pages later, as time flew by, I was still reading and turning the pages. And suddenly I reached the end of the first chapter. I just wanted to keep on reading and I was suddenly completely drawn into this book which I had avoided for so long. In the first Chapter I had only met Paul Atreides, Jessica and the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. There was also a mysterious test that Paul was going to face, which involved an object named ‚Äúgom jabbar‚Äù.

In the following chapters I met the Duke Leto Atreides, Paul‚Äôs father, and some members from his household, including Gurney Halleck, Duncan Idaho, Dr. Yueh and the ‚ÄúMentat‚Äù Thufir Hawat. I learned that the Atreides family was in a dynastic feud with the Harkonnens and the plot was full of intrigue, betrayal and deception. The members of the Atreides faction were worried and concerned about moving from their home planet of Caladan to the desert planet of Arrakis, also known as Dune, where water might be the most valuable possession one could have, even more so than gold, where there are sandworms and also spice - ‚Äúthe crop for which Arrakis in the unique source‚Äù.

After years of delaying the day I would read Dune, I just couldn‚Äôt put it down, even after what some might consider to be a somewhat slow start to the story, which gets deeper as the plot advances and we learn more about Dune‚Äôs cultural, religious, political, sociological and ecological landscape. In fact, there are far too many terms in Dune which are unfamiliar to the reader at first, but I later discovered that Dune‚Äôs complexity, as well as its length, lead to its depth and I found myself becoming emotionally attached to characters which felt genuine.

I could go on to mention all the historical, cultural and religious themes which influenced Frank Herbert‚Äôs writing. I could mention how much some parts of the plot reminded me of Arabic culture and traditions. Or how surprising it was to see ecology being heavily featured in a science fiction book. But I will just say that I‚Äôm glad I opened Dune after all this years and read it. Dune is a truly epic story and a classic of science fiction.

Epic. Brilliant. While making my way through this story, it was all I wanted to do in life.

I listened to the audio, but also picked up a hardcopy book at the library to check names, spellings, and read the appendices in the back of the book. The glossary in this edition was very helpful in keeping all of the mythology and worldbuilding straight.

ETA on 2nd reading (9/5/2020): Still struck with the overall story. I understood a lot more this time around - no doubt since I've continued reading the series since initial reading in 2018. Looking forward to Villaneuve's film even moreso now. I was able to picture many of the actors as the characters while re-reading.

This book is suddenly circulating everywhere because the movie is coming. So, I thought I should finally read it. I'm congratulating myself for finally finishing this one. I think everyone who finished it deserves a big hand of applause.

DBR to follow, at Ceridwen's request. She must have used one of her Bene Gesserit tricks on me.

Dune. Dune is a fascinating book. A classic of science-fiction, it plays equally as fantasy and allegory. It is deeply textured, richly layered. And if you want to read a sensible review of it, I'd go read, say, Cedriwen's. This one is going to be full of silliness.

Arrakis. The desert planet. Home to spice and sandworms. Dune. You know, I went to the desert once. The Sahara Desert. It looked like this (ps I took this picture!):



I don't feel like tracking down a picture from the movie, so you have to imagine what Arrakis looks like. It looks a lot like the Sahara.

So anyway, one of the "things to do" when you're in Morocco is to drive out into the Sahara and go for a camel ride, stay overnight in a Berber tent. Ah, camels. I don't know if any of you have ridden a camel (but I'm sure if you have, you will back me up on this): not as much fun as you would think. Riding a horse is, let's face it, always a little uncomfortable. You have to straddle it (twss!), you have to keep your legs at a weird angle (twss!), it starts to hurt after a while (uh... twss?). Riding a camel, on the other hand, sucks. Camels do not wear saddles. They wear blankets. A camel's hump is not very squishy for something that is supposed to be full of water, if my elementary school understanding of why they can live in the desert is accurate. If kind of feels like you are sitting on a rock, and it feels like someone is repeatedly hitting your public bone with a baseball bat. This is not just a guy thing; my girlfriend confirmed that after about five minutes, riding a camel ceases being at all fun and becomes an exercise in pain management. It hurt like hell while it was happening, and it was hard to walk the next day (om, twss!).

On Dune, the desert-inhabiting Fremen don't ride . They ride these:



Scary. But probably not more uncomfortable to ride than a camel.

Look, this is me with Fergie. I am smiling because I am no longer riding it.



Other than the sand and stuff, Arrakis is pretty different from Western Africa. Like the sandworms, which attack anyone who dares venture into the desert, there are the Fremen, a mysterious tribe of fighters who have a strange relationship with what they call "the Markers," there is this stuff called spice that must be carefully harvested from the sands, the risk rewarded by the incredible worth of the spice as a drug used by the Guild to gives the navigators the prescient sight they need to chart courses through hyperspace, and by the Bene Gesserit witches, why use it to preserve their ways from generation to generation. Also I don't think Dune had package tours.

Dune is a famously boring and complicated book. You may have heard that it has a lengthy appendix, and that when David Lynch turned it into a movie, the story was so complex that audiences had to be given cheat sheets along with their tickets. (Don't blame Frank Herbert for that, though. The Dune movie is just marvelously bad, as this chart will illustrate:

)

Don't let its reputation fool you. Sure, Dune is a little bit boring in parts (the characters like to philosophize redundantly and have prophetic visions). But it is also an awesome space opera, with an entirely transporting sense of place and vidiv world-building. The political struggles that drive the plot engine are fiendishly complex to the occasional point of obtusion (I can't believe that is a word), but also a lot of fun to read about, thanks to sneering villains like Baron Harkonnen, who isn't just any old bad guy, but a grossly obese, slithery, murdering, rapist pedophile. The Fremen, a tribe of deeply spiritual religious fanatics who control a natural resource and are willing to die for what they believe... in. And then there are the sandworms. I loved everything about this concept, from Herbert's vivid descriptions, to their presence as an omnipresent threat throughout the book, to their epic inclusion in the explosion and violence-heavy climax. Awesome.

I haven't really said anything about the book. It's good. It's Dune. It is a super-famous classic for a reason. It has compelling characters (Lady Jessica is one of the most interesting female protagonists in classic sci-fi, and the book's take on gender politics, with an elite group of women are a powerful, secretive and controlling force in the galaxy , is worth examining.) It is epic in scope. It's nearly as deep as Tolkien (there's that appendix).

It's also just cool.

Absolutely phenomenal. I regret not reading this sooner but I think this will become a favourite. Maybe something I read each year. There's a lot to take in so I might add more to this review later (especially as I'm now going to read the 5 sequels)

A must read

6.0 stars. On my list of All Time Favorite Novels. Arguably the greatest Science Fiction novel ever written and certainly a standard by which other works are judged. The best way I can think of to describe the world and characters created by Frank Herbert in his Dune series is "staggering." HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!

Winner: Hugo Award for Best Novel

I didn't like the movie (1984) so I wanted to read the book thinking it'll be better than the movie.
No, No, and No
This book is NOT getting to me. ü§î The audio is really of quality with full cast and some sound effects. But the material is as dry as Arrakis!

Man oh man, this was just not for me. The dialogue is insanely clunky and stilted. The linear world building, it doesn't feel like a world being given to you to explore but rather a railroad track tour of the world. Woe to the reader if you want to get off the track.

I've seen people come to the defense of this saying well it was written in the 60's in terms of dialogue, info dumps, monologues, and strange terms that aren't well explained. That's not really an excuse, in my opinion. The large issue is that it seems to not have aged well, at all. It's been well surpassed writing wise.

The near constant recaps of the previous chapters are largely unnecessary and just serve to annoy rather than help. The ending...was never really in doubt telegraphed from about 3 miles away with our near perfect great white hope savior. It was just more of a relief for me to finish it than be happy about it.

That said, I can see where/why this novel is the Grandaddy so to speak of the science fiction world. I just think it's time to stop measuring anything newer against it, politely nodding as Grandad rants and raves while we help him walk to his bed and put him to rest. I'm glad I read it in the sense that one is glad they try a new food and learn they don't like it so at least they can say they have the experience of doing so and their opinion is grounded in experience.

It's been years since I've read straight up science fiction or fantasy, and this was a wonderful mixture of the two. It was an internally consistent world vividly portrayed, Herbert has a touch of the poetic in describing his desert planet Arrakis, which I appreciated. I listened to it in an audio version that used actors to play the various roles, which at first I found irritating but later settled into and enjoyed immensely.

Dune traces the coming of age of a new King--Paul Atreides-- as the House Atreides is moved from the wet planet Callisto to the desert planet--and we move from a vaguely Greek (House of Atreides) flavor of myth to one with vaguely Arabic overtones on the desert planet. Women surprisingly feature largely in the book--especially those belonging to the secret all-female Bene Gesserrit order, women imbued with great powers and knowledge, to which Paul's mother belongs. It's a basic hero plot but well done, with rival baddie house House Harkonnen, and lots of interesting devices and orders of character. The era's fascination with psychedelic drugs is well-captured by the treasure of Arrakis--Spice, which the competing planetary Houses and the space transport Guild rely upon.

A real Ace/Tor old school sci fi fantasy. I'd gone through an intense period of sci fi and fantasy reading earlier in my life-- lots of Zelazny, Philip K. Dick , Ursula K. LeGuin and Philip Jose Farmer-- but had not tried Dune until the film tickled my interest.

As a writer, it was fascinating to see the things Herbert does exceptionally well. He handles a constantly-shifting omniscient point of view wonderfully well--something you'd never see in a Dick novel--so that all the cards are always on the table, and each scene shimmers with the varying points of view. He's also masterful in building suspense, packing the buildup to each major scene action with detail, much the way Poe did. I enjoyed it tremendously while I was reading it. Five stars for pure escapist entertainment.

I might have fallen in love with Gurney Halleck.

I‚Äôm not typically a fantasy or sci-fi fan, but this one really drew me in. The story is extremely compelling, the type you don‚Äôt want to quit reading, even if it‚Äôs long past midnight.

The characters are genuinely interesting‚ÄîI quickly developed a soft spot for Jessica and Halleck. This is one of the most important parts of a story for me.

The only downfall of this book was its rushed and disappointing ending. Other than that, I‚Äôm in love with it.

Four and a half sandworms.

I did not expect it, it has been a whole rediscovery. It is my third reading of Dune but from the previous ones many years ago. I did not remember how complete this novel is, as a great adventure, as its own worldbuilding and philosophy, as space opera galactic empire and of course as a sense of wonder: the desert, the worms, the greatness they evoke. Definitely a great classic that has not become outdated since it was published in 1965.

PS: I do not intend to read the sequels, many people tell me that it is not worth it. Apparently for die-hard fans only. So now we have to wait for the Denis Villeneuve's movie.

‚ÄúMi chiameranno... Muad'Dib,
¬´Colui che Indica la Strada¬ª.
S√¨, cos√¨ mi chiameranno.‚Äù

Un libro cult della letteratura di fantascienza.
Non facile nel suo impianto narrativo.

L‚Äôesistenza immaginata da Herbert non si circoscrive ad un pianeta ma ad un Universo dove pianeti, dominati da Case di Nobili ostili tra loro, sono orchestrate da un supremo Imperatore.
Scritto nel 1965 sorprende per la sua complessit√† che lo differenzia da molte opere dello stesso genere che all‚Äôepoca miravano a una fantascienza metafora della Guerra Fredda in atto.

Herbert fa qualcosa di pi√π: su una trama di perfidi intrighi di corte costruisce un mondo dove la Religione diventa un‚Äôarma velenosa e l‚ÄôEcologia un antidoto di sopravvivenza.

Impossibile non riconoscere un‚Äôeco lungimirante:





La guerra tra la dinastia di Atreides e quella degli Harkonnen ha come baricentro il pianeta di Arrakis: un luogo tanto ostile, nel suo paesaggio desertico percosso da tempeste di sabbia e infestato da giganteschi e mostruosi vermi, quanto prezioso.
Su Arrakis, infatti cresce il Melange, ossia una spezia che d√† assuefazione e conosciuta come fonte per i poteri di preveggenza.
Fra le due casate in lotta c‚Äô√® l‚Äôantico popolo indigeno dei Fremen...

Complicato per la terminologia che costringe a consultare le utili appendici ma affascinante e coinvolgente.

Top 10 favourite book of all time! I'm having a good run of books from that point of view at the moment.

Told in the voice of an omniscient narrator the plot unfolds with practised ease around the cast. I'm not used to this style of narration and found it to be very powerful. Knowing the private thoughts and reactions of relevant characters in certain scenes was often vastly more revealing than anything else could have been.

The world building was simply brilliant. The universe with it's politics and intrigues grew naturally and elegantly as the book progressed. There were a number of fascinating details such as the outlawing of computers and training humans to be computer-like called Menats. I wonder how hard it would be to train us to be machine like in our thinking? There are other 'abilities' humans develop through training that I wonder about.

Paul is one of my favourite characters ever written and I knew that was going to be true fairly early on.


I can see why this is hailed as a classic and would recommend it to anyone and everyone. Can't wait to get on with the rest of the series.

One of my favourite quotes from the book:

"There is in all things a pattern that is part of our universe. It has symmerty, elegance, and grace -- those qualities you find always in that which the true artist captures. You can find it in the turning of the seasons, in the way sand trails along a ridge, in the branch clusters of the creosote bush or the pattern of its leaves. We try to copy these patterns in our lives and our society, seeking the rhythms, the dances, the forms that comfort. Yet, it is possible to see peril in the finding of untimate perfection. It is clear that the ultimate pattern contains its own fixity. In such perfection, all things move toward death."

This novel is a terrific exercise in world-building, and a fantastic space opera to boot. The desert planet Arrakis (where even body fluids have to be recycled through "stillsuits", so great is the water scarcity) is one of the most enchanting fictional worlds I have ever visited. And the story! - truly mythical in its dimension with empire, intrigue and desert warfare. I loved it all the way through.

With the Lady Jessica and Arrakis, the Bene Gesserit system of sowing implant-legends through the Missionaria Protectiva came to its full fruition ‚Ä¶ And it is generally accepted now that her latent abilities were grossly underestimated
- From ‚ÄúAnalysis: The Arrakeen Crisis‚Äù by the Princess Irulan


2015 was the 50th anniversary of Frank Herbert‚Äôs , which was published by Chilton in 1965.





(Wiki)









The author was known as one of the earliest fiction writers to speak about the ecosystem and ecological concerns. The Afterward by his son is a good source for personal information about Frank Herbert. Another on-line source I happened across if this article from




Dune and its five sequels
constitute the best selling SF series of all time. In the depth of its tale of human rule in the galaxy it has been compared to Tolkien‚Äôs saga. Like Tolkien, Herbert produced elements of a language used in the saga, containing enough special terms that he included a glossary in the book. These terms were derived by Herbert from many different earth languages. The Afterward in the edition I read lists Navajo, Latin, Chakobsa (of the Caucasus), the Nahuatl dialect of the Aztecs, Greek, Persian, East Indian, Russian, Turkish, Finnish, Old English ‚Äì and last, but hardly least, since it stands out particularly, Arabic.


Herbert included a map with the novel (like Tolkien‚Äôs map of Middle Earth) and four appendices, in which he added detail to the novel ‚Äì The Ecology of Dune, The Religion of Dune, Report on Bene Gesserit Motives and Purposes, and The Almanak En-Ashraf (Selected excerpts of the Noble Houses).




Set over 20,000 years in the future, at a time when humans have colonized (from Earth) most of the galaxy. The galaxy-wide governing Imperium is medieval in character, with an Emperor ruling over Great Houses. The novel takes place on the planet Arrakis, a remote location of unimaginable value to both the Emperor and the Great Houses - being the only known source in the galaxy for . This is a spice which is used crucially by the ; to prolong life and protect against disease (by those able to obtain it); and (by the ) to enhance their secret mental abilities.






The , rules the Imperium at the time of the novel. He is the 81st such ruler in his bloodline, the House Corrino. His fighting forces, the Sardaukar, are the most vicious and feared warriors in the galaxy.



The Spacing Guild is a powerful commercial entity having a monopoly on both interstellar travel and banking within the Imperium. Of special note are Guild , who (through a cultivated addiction to melange) have developed the ability to guide spacecraft from one star system to another through ‚Äúfolded space‚Äù at instantaneous speeds.



House Atreides, in the person of (the Red Duke), begins the novel ruling the planet Caladan. Leto is pressured by the Emperor to move his kingdom to Arrakis near the start of the novel, and take over the governance of that important planet. Leto is the father of , the main character of the novel. Paul‚Äôs mother, a concubine of the Duke‚Äôs, is ‚Äì a Bene Gesserit who is the main female character.



House Harkonnen is a house with blood relation to House Atreides, but at the time of the novel the two houses have become sworn enemies. House Harkonnen supplies most of the villains for the story, the chief being .



The Bene Gesserit are an ancient society of women, both well-known in the Imperium but also very secret regarding their mental abilities and ultimate purposes. Often referred to in the novel as ‚Äúwitches‚Äù, by characters who hate and fear them.



The Fremen are the native, desert-dwelling population of Arrakis. They play a momentous role in , and in the sequels.




Herbert was not interested in writing a novel exploring technological advances in the far future. This is one of the things which set his novel apart from most science fiction of the 1960s. Rather, he wished to tell a story about the development of human psychology, mental abilities, and religion, as man explored and colonized the galaxy. Herbert developed an interesting means of taking technology out of the story ‚Äì the Butlerian Jihad. (Information about this is contained in the appendices, not much in the story itself.) The Butlerian Jihad was a war that mankind waged against ‚Äúcomputers, thinking machines and conscious robots‚Äù approximately in the middle of the 20,000 years between our present and the time of . Once man (with great difficulty) had won this war, which raged across the galaxy for a century, an edict was set forth which would thereafter govern man‚Äôs relation to technology (a Prime Directive, if you will): ‚ÄúThou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.‚Äù





Some readers have voiced concerns about gender issues in Dune. It does portray a galactic ruling society in which males are the dominant rulers of the Great Houses, and have both wives and concubines. Well, it is a story. The author is not espousing this model as the way a society should be set up. The Bene Gesserit society of women have awesome mental powers and clearly have engineered much of the very long range plot line of the backstory, which comes to fruition in the novel. It is also made explicitly clear in the novel that both Leto and his son Paul revere and love the ‚Äúconcubine‚Äù women that bear their sons, and hold the official wives they might marry as merely political unions (along the lines of betrothals between royalty in ages past here on Earth).

So, even if you are repelled about male domination of females (which I am) I don't believe this novel will upset you.

‚ÄúThe Fremen have the word of Muad‚ÄôDib,‚Äù Paul said. ‚ÄúThere will be flowing water here open to the sky and green oases rich with good things. But we have the spice to think of, too. Thus, there will always be desert on Arrakis‚Ä¶and fierce winds, and trials to toughen a man. We Fremen have a saying: ‚ÄòGod created Arrakis to train the faithful.‚Äô One cannot go against the word of God.‚Äù

Rereading ‚ÄòDune‚Äô a couple of decades after I first encountered it as a teenager, I can still remember being swept up by its exoticism, mystery and action, a heady blend as addictive as the spice melange itself. But from the vantage point of 2021, an astonishing 56 years after its initial publication ‚Äì and it is currently still an Amazon bestseller ‚Äì it is clear that the very basis for the reputation, longevity and interpretation of ‚ÄòDune‚Äô is as mercurial as the shifting sands of Arrakis itself.

In an article from The Guardian entitled ‚ÄòDune, 50 years on: how a science fiction novel changed the world‚Äô (3 July 2015), Hari Kunzru comments that: ‚ÄúBooks read differently as the world reforms itself around them, and the Dune of 2015 has geopolitical echoes that it didn‚Äôt in 1965, before the oil crisis and 9/11.‚Äù Barely a decade later, and the world around us has irrevocably changed yet again. Kunzru elaborates:



I think the problem with ‚ÄòDune‚Äô is that it has become hermetically sealed by its own success, removed from the constraints of time and genre. Kunzru rightfully points out that Herbert‚Äôs own influences at the time were the Barsoom series by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the Lensman series by E.E. ‚ÄòDoc‚Äô Smith and, of course, the Foundation saga by Isaac Asimov, itself the subject of a new big-budget Apple+ television adaptation. These were the SF writers I was familiar with, and which shaped my view of the genre at the same time as I engaged with Herbert‚Äôs work. In this context, ‚ÄòDune‚Äô was but another iteration of that genre, and not the iconic object of veneration it has become today:



In terms of ‚Äòpolitical relevance‚Äô, it is clear that Denis Villeneuve is taking the proverbial bull by the horns with his latest adaptation. The second trailer reveals that the story is framed by Chani, who has experienced first-hand the brutal colonial subjugation of the Harkonnens, and who cynically wonders if the incoming Atreides will simply be their next oppressors.

This is in marked contrast to David Lynch using Princess Irulan to frame his 1984 adaptation, speaking with the hindsight of history, but still representing the ultimate expression of that colonialist mindset, as represented by her father the Emperor, the Landsraad, CHOAM, the Guild and, let us not forget, the Bene Gesserit itself.

Perhaps an unintended consequence of the Villeneuve trailer‚Äôs focus on the Paul/Chani relationship, obviously due to the marketing department honing in on the combined fan base of Timoth√©e Chalamet and Zendaya to generate buzz and success for the upcoming movie, is that it foregrounds the ‚Äòwhite saviour‚Äô theme that seems so troubling in ‚ÄòDune‚Äô, especially in our time where issues of race and gender are so highly politicised and emotive.

It is only troubling though if you have not read ‚ÄòDune Messiah‚Äô, where Herbert effectively and quite devastatingly turns the previous book on its head, taking the ‚Äòhero‚Äô story of Paul in a rather unexpected direction ‚Ä¶ a direction that becomes ever stranger and more baroque by the time we reach ‚ÄòGod Emperor of Dune‚Äô and ‚ÄòHeretics of Dune‚Äô, my two favourite books in the entire sequence.

What I found remarkable about this reread of ‚ÄòDune‚Äô (my third, I think) is how quick a read it is. The page counts among the various editions seem to vary as wildly as the reported length of Shai Hulud, ranging from 500 to 800. I think the former is more accurate. Anyway, the narrative races along at quite a furious clip. I must say it does slow down in the third section, ‚ÄòThe Prophet‚Äô, which does feel like a lot of filler as we build up towards the climactic battle.

Much has been said about how dire Herbert‚Äôs writing style is. Yes, most of the characters are cardboard cut-outs, with their thoughts and responses telegraphed in italicised speech that is the literary equivalent of speech bubbles in a graphic novel (speaking of which, ‚ÄòDune‚Äô now exists in that format as well, including a series of shorter comic books, if I‚Äôm not mistaken.)

What do we really know of Gurney Halleck and Duncan Idaho, apart from the broadest of writerly brush strokes? Even Paul himself does not convince, starting out as a callow 15-year-old and ending up defeating the Padishah Emperor himself. The women fare no better, with Mohiam repeatedly referred to as a ‚Äòcrone‚Äô or a ‚Äòwitch‚Äô, and a boilerplate reference to Chani‚Äôs ‚Äòdark elfin features‚Äô, which is meant to alert the reader to her ‚Äònative attractions‚Äô, I think.

No, what makes ‚ÄòDune‚Äô really stand out is the exemplary world-building. What struck me rereading this is how conditioned we have become, via the David Lynch and SyFy Channel adaptations in particular, to think of it as, well, a barren desert planet, when in fact it is a fully-fledged ecology. Herbert‚Äôs nature writing and scene setting here are quite painterly, giving us an intimate glimpse of the fauna and flora of Arrakis (yes, there are even flowers and birds!)

We now know, thanks to Kim Stanley Robinson and his Mars trilogy, that terraforming is not politically correct. But Herbert states quite clearly that the Fremen intuitively comprehend the intimate relationship between the desert, the worms and the spice. They only plan to terraform the more accessible parts, leaving the deep unchartered sands to Shai Hulud himself.

What Herbert does so skilfully in ‚ÄòDune‚Äô is to craftily use his action set pieces as disguised info dumps. Think of scenes like Liet Kynes taking the Duke and Paul via ornithopter to see spice mining for the first time. We the reader see this incredible spectacle through the eyes of our protagonists, experiencing what they are seeing and feeling, while learning about the planet‚Äôs intricate and dangerous symbiotic sandworm lifeforms at the same time.

Herbert similarly uses the Paul-versus-Jamis fight to educate the reader about Fremen rites and sociocultural practices, particularly as these relate to religion and death. Jamis‚Äôs burial is oddly elegiac and moving, a moment of great stillness and reflection in the wake of the desperate and lethal combat that preceded it. The Jamis fight is followed immediately by Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen celebrating his seventeenth birthday by dispatching his hundredth gladiator to an adoring crowd in an arena on Giedi Prime.

We learn early on in the book that the Baron is actually Paul‚Äôs
, but Herbert does not really do much with this. I wonder therefore if the Baron‚Äôs paedophelia-or-homosexuality (I don‚Äôt think it is really clear in which camp he falls), is but one end of a Kinsey Scale of a familial chain, with the depraved Harkonnens at one end and the rigidly moralistic Atreides at the other.

I was surprised to read somewhere that Frank Herbert had a complex relationship with a gay son that went unresolved until the latter‚Äôs death from AIDS in 1993 (Brian Herbert briefly refers to his brother in ‚ÄòDreamer of Dune‚Äô, his hagiography of his father.) However, I honestly don‚Äôt think one can read too much into this.

At the end of the day, ‚ÄòDune‚Äô remains as gloriously inscrutable and probably as batshit crazy as it must have done to its original readership. Actually, kudos to David Lynch‚Äôs screenplay, which manages to wrestle the beast into somewhat of a malleable form, despite such Star Trek liberties as the ‚Äòweirding modules‚Äô. And that closing shot of it raining on Arrakis.

The Villeneuve trailers to date have used much of the Lynchian iconography, such as the framing device and Paul‚Äôs visions of Chani and the Fremen, not to mention the trip to Arrakis in the Guild‚Äôs heighliners, which is a mere throwaway line later in the book. Integral characters like Chani and Stilgar appear in person only much later, and Lynch quite cleverly used Paul‚Äôs visions as a kind of linking device to splice the narrative together.

SOME THOUGHTS ON THE LATEST DUNE MOVIE ADAPTATION
When Villeneuve took on the project, he apparently stated he would only do so if he would be allowed to make two movies. That apocryphal story has since changed, with it being reported that no second movie has been greenlit, pending the success of the first one. As with ‚ÄòHarry Potter‚Äô and ‚ÄòLord of the Rings‚Äô, one would have thought that Warner Bros. would have given Villeneuve the go-ahead to write, develop and shoot the movies back-to-back to save costs and ensure continuity. The recent IMAX unveiling of the first ten minutes of footage did, apparently, feature a title card clearly stating ‚ÄòDUNE: PART 1‚Äô.

With a run time of 155 minutes, Villeneuve has also said that his movie only covers the ‚Äòfirst half‚Äô of the book. Current speculation as to the cut-off point is either Paul‚Äôs fight with Jamis or Jessica taking the Water of Life. The former seems more likely, although I do hope Villeneuve includes the elaborate funeral ceremony and subsequent insight into Fremen culture this allows. However, this probably does mean that Part 1 is likely to end on a rather subdued note if it goes full Jamis, so maybe the Water of Life is a better cliffhanger?

What I suspect though ‚Äì and there is an inkling of this in comments from some of the crew such as cinematographer Greig Fraser that Part 1 is entirely ‚Äòself-contained‚Äô ‚Äì is that Villeneuve has done his own ‚Äòtake‚Äô on ‚ÄòDune‚Äô that eschews many of the plot elements, action set pieces and even characters we are so familiar with. So come its release end October, we could be in for a rude awakening ‚Ä¶ (How much of a veil of secrecy is likely to be cast on its screening at the Venice Film Festival remains to be seen.)

This book is HEAVY! I am behind the times on this classic novel. I went in the wrong direction due to a hugely long waitlist to check this book out. I watched the most recent movie and then read the book. Honestly, I thought the movie did a pretty good job. The main issue with this book is that it is SOOOOOO long. It should have been split in two.

The third book section and beyond felt less developed and edited. There were a lot of newer concepts, and the relationships were extremely rushed. I wonder if Frank Herbert originally intended this to be a single novel and was trying to wrap up the ending.

With that being said. This book is epic as F. You must read it. The beginning is very Sci-Fi heavy, but after they are established on the new planet, it reads more like an epic fantasy. The characters have immense development. And somehow, I still wanted more of the culture.

Worth a read at least once in your life.

4-4.5 Stars. I will definitely continue on with the series.

Intrigue Imbroglio! Conspiracy or Conniption!: "Well, The Emperor tried one way, the Harkonnens another, the Bene Gesserit schemed a third way, the Guild a fourth way, - and yet - a desert mouse spanked them all!" - The Fremen Bugle.

An awesome novel of intrigue over action, as the youthful Paul Atreides encounters a nearly overwhelming destiny and rises above it by preserving his essential moral core.

P.S. A bit of a manual on power, manipulation, and intrigue in a sci-fi setting.

P.P.S. Do not try Bene Gesserit voice controls at home, I can attest that they don't actually work...(much to my dismay!)

P.P.P.S. I was equally dismayed by the fact that 'the Force,' didn't work from me either... I'm beginning to think that sci-fi authors are just making it all up...

Liz against the world's rating: 3.9 Stars

Look at me, here I am reading Hugo's winner Dune 50 years after its publication and living to tell the tale. Dune is, without doubt, a groundbreaking story with a complex and enthralling universe. The concept of Dune is exhilarating: sandworms, a messiah, the Fremen and their spice.

The actual reading, however, is a slightly less perfect experience.



Princess Irulan states from the beginning that precocious Paul is not only meant for greatness, he's already a Legend. So Dune is not much about Paul struggling to believe he's the One as it is about Paul in his heroic journey fighting his fate: the unstoppable Fremen jihad he so much wants to avoid. We can see him time after time refusing to be what his prescience has showed him.

And on that note,The funny thing is, Herbert keeps telling the story as if you haven't already been warned.




When you talk about Dune, you have to admit the world-building is flawless but when it comes to character development, time-skip is its biggest enemy and mine: I'm a characters reader. And even if the characters were on spot most of the time,

There is little to no characterization maybe because Herbert indulges his interest in ecology, political philosophy, religion and the messianic quest more than anything else which, if I understand correctly,

I didn't get to see the actual of the characters and so there was a lot of guessing for me: about Fremen as a society, Paul and Chani's relationship, his son, and more. It's a page turner, alright, but because you're in painful need to make sense of the story. And you kinda love it, honestly.



Despite all this, I'm completely captivated by Herbert's creative world. I couldn't get enough of Paul's ability to see present, past and future as a now, the pseudo-technology, the Bene Gesserit and of course, the spice and its properties to name a few.

All in all, it was a great book and I enjoyed a lot of it even if I fought with Herbert through the whole experience. I'm not sure if I'll keep up with the series, though, but I'm sure fans of the genre will absolutely love this.

I read this book the first time last year and I absolutely loved it. I loved it so much I had to reread it again this year but this time I'm tackling the rest of the series too.

My review of the book from last year is down below:



This book was awesome!! Not only was the adventure amazing but the growth of the characters in this story is something every writer can learn from to make their own characters more real. The desert planet setting had a life of it's own. It was believable. Herbert's talent as a writer is undeniable. There is a reason Dune is one of the greatest epics of science fiction.

Paul Atreides/Muad'Dib/Kwisatz Haderach is an amazing character. Originally groomed to be the Duke of Caladan by his father Leto, he and his family are sent away by the emperor to a desert planet called Arrakis, or Dune. Paul's life is overturned by treachery from those the family trusted most. On Dune Paul must learn to survive the harsh environment of this Tatooine-like planet and perhaps one day avenge the traitorous plot against his noble family.

It surprises me how some of the greatest books are set in desert-like settings. In Star Wars the main body of the story is set on Tatooine, a desert planet. The Way of Kings is mostly set on the Shattered Plains where it is dry and arid (though not as devoid of water as Dune or Tatooine). The symbology of it is awesome.

I also found it interesting how Herbert weaves so much symbology, anthropology, and moral lessons into this story. I felt like I was reading an ethnography of the Fremen peoples. By the end I knew who they were, what they ate, what their religion was, how they buried their dead, and so on. This book was richer because of Herbert's careful planning and research. I found it very cool how the people even save the water from their breath, and even from the dead, because in all deserts water is sacred.

The ritual of how Paul got the name Muad'Dib, reminded me how in some cultures the giving of a name is just as important as one's birth. Muad'Dib means mouse. I liked that. Its interesting how different groups perceive things differently. We look at a mouse and think of a critter that gets into our house or carries disease, but in Fremen culture they are seen as "wise in the ways of the desert. Muad'Dib creates his own water. Muad'Dib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night. Muad'Dib is fruitful and multiplies over the land. Muad'Dib we call 'instructor-of-boys.' That is a powerful base on which to build your life, Paul-Muad'Dib, who is Usul among us. We welcome you." Its interesting to think that through the eyes of the Fremen they look at the mouse as wise and something they try to mimic. Its funny how people find wisdom. Probably why traveling the world and seeing the world through the eyes of others only adds to our life the those lives around us.

In conclusion I would definitely recommend this book, not only because it was the first to win the Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and undoubtedly set the stage for science fiction, but it is a story we can all relate to and it shows how nothing is more important than family.

In anticipation of the film that is to be released later this year, 2021 for anyone that bothers to read this in many a year‚Äôs time, I have reread Dune! A reread of any kind this late in my life is a rarity.
How did it go? Wonderful.

In my youth, I considered it a masterpiece in its field. Sci Fi just did not come much better back in the day. (1976 is back in the day, I was 16.) I was so impressed, I think I may have read it a dozen times in as many years.

That was then. So with a read again after all these decades, the fact of the matter is that into my fast approaching dotage it is still a masterpiece in its field.

By goodness, this film had better be good.

Maybe 3.5. A really interesting novel. I loved the world-building and the world itself, and some of the central characters were fascinating. The plot was a little confusing at times, and I did find a few aspects of this a little jarring, but in general it was a good and interesting read.

A masterpiece that still stands up today due to the strength of the author's characterisations.
Dune is a totally immersing reading experience ; the level of world building on show is truly incredible.
An epic book that has a lot of space within the writing that leaves the imagination to do the work. For instance ; there are no big descriptions of set piece battles. The readers experience of them is all told second hand from the view point of those who were not necessarily directly involved. This should prove exciting from the new movies perspective as it looks like the director Denis Villneuve's has given his own imagination free reign in bringing Dune to the screen, while still staying faithful to the book. (Excellent article and interviews in this months SFX magazine,by the way) .A wonderful must read Sci-fi epic and I can't wait for the movie to come out.

Dune is one of those classics that I've long been aware of, but never really felt like tackling. I remember bits and pieces from the 1984 movie, and I've definitely heard sci-fi lovers wax all poetic about the books. Yet with over 800 pages in the first book, setting time aside for it always felt like such a chore.

Then I went to watch the 2021 movie, spent over 2 hours admiring Zendaya's soulful blue eyes, and fangirling over Jessica's creepy Bene Gesserit voice... only to realize at the end, that not much of the world made sense to me. So with frustration prevailing, I finally picked up the first book.



The story is simple enough: 15-year-old heir to the House of Atreides, Paul, finds himself running
for his life on the desert planet of Arrakis. With most of his family murdered, his mother in grieving mood more often than not, the young boy is forced to rely on his budding (and extremely confusing) prescient abilities to survive.

The events are powered by a complex mix of politics and religion, with a liberal sprinkling of ecological theories. I loved the politics, especially the chapters describing the enemy tactics, and the ecological details painted a very interesting picture of the desert planet. The religious aspects however, were not to my taste. Admittedly, I do have some very deeply-rooted personal bias when it comes to this topic, so I may be looking at things more critically than others.



Even so, with enough foreshadowing, I think I may have eventually warmed up to the whole prescient Messianic Child hype. Additionally, I had the bright idea to put the book on hold for a couple of weeks, in order to catch up with other books from my reading goal. And when I came back, I was never able to immerse myself in quite the same way.

That said, I'd still attribute a big part of my disappointing experience to the story's sudden penchant for time skips: years, months, weeks you name it. The last 80 pages have them in spades. Though I did occasionally find the day by day approach tedious, the sudden shift in pacing was too jarring.



And worst of all, the time skips didn't feel entirely justified. Or perhaps I felt the need for a few more bridging phrases, especially for that first 3-year time skip. You can't just put everything on fast-forward, set significant character development between scenes, also expect the reader to get emotional during the final scenes.



On the whole, watching both the movie and reading the book was a good choice. The former shows a more human side of 15-year-old Paul, while the latter fills in the gaps from the world-building.

Listening to the audio production made this an enjoyable experience. I had tried to read Dune twice before and could not get through it. The last time was many years ago. I might have been able to now, as an older adult, but I wanted to finish so I thought an audiobook with a full cast was the way to go. I'm glad I did it this way.

I will fully acknowledge that Dune must have been WAY ahead of its time. Sort to like LOTR was for epic fantasy. And yeah, I would also call it a classic, a masterpiece, pick your favorite label. They would apply. The story is absolutely epic. I like the mix of tech and mysticism. The mind and creativity that came up with this is nothing short of astounding.



Yeah it does present some difficulties. At least it did for me and I could very much be off base on some of these points, so take all this with a grain of salt. It does have a lot of world building. I normally really, really like that. But here it was pretty dense. I don't know how else to put it. It also seemed to have large jumps in time (unless I'm missing something) where there was significant events that basically I had to try to infer. Like Paul having kids? One moment he's developing feelings for the Fremen woman, the next "part" of the book starts and he's got kids. Maybe I missed something in there. And then there seemed to be a jump where they were gearing up for a war on Arrakis, and then, again, a new "Part" starts and the war had been raging for some time. It just seemed odd to me to skip over much quickly. It also seemed odd to me that they have space travel, interstellar and an illusion box that can make it look like your hand is burning, but to me it sounded like most of the combat (other than nukes) was with knives. Interesting.

And here's the one I'm probably most going to get rapped in the mouth for. I wasn't, candidly, all that crazy about Paul. I get that he's noble-born and all that and he's in conflict with a family that is trying to wipe him and his out. But even with his own guys, sometimes he came across as kind of haughty.

But I honestly liked it enough to get the audio (if there is one) for the next book. Maybe someday I'll try re-reading a hard copy too. Seems to me this is one of those books that you would get more from each time you read it. Certainly is that way for me with LOTR.

"El miedo mata la mente. El miedo es la peque√±a muerte que conduce a la destrucci√≥n total. Afrontar√© mi miedo. Permitir√© que pase sobre m√≠ y a trav√©s de m√≠. Y cuando haya pasado, girar√© mi ojo interior para escrutar su camino."


Lo primero a resaltar de Dune es la narrativa. Y debo admitir que a m√≠ me fascin√≥. El autor nos permite conocer el punto de vista de cada personaje en una misma escena, y lo logra de manera pulcra, sin generar confusi√≥n cuando se pasa de los pensamientos de uno a los de otro.

En cuanto a la historia, nos presenta la traves√≠a de la familia Atreides en Arrakis, un planeta des√©rtico al cual deben mudarse por orden del La trama est√° cargada de muchos giros inesperados; siento que la primera parte funciona perfectamente como un introductorio a este nuevo mundo, nos presenta a los personajes y las peculiaridades del planeta; sin embargo, siento que la segunda parte es una monta√±a rusa de sucesos que pasan muy r√°pido y dejan cierta incertidumbre. Y, aunque todo parece un poco predecible, no lo es.

El mundo que nos presenta Frank Herbert est√° muy bien creado, y tiene todos los elementos esenciales para convertirla en una gran obra de desde el protagonista Paul con sus incre√≠bles poderes hasta los enigm√°ticos gusanos de arena y todo el sistema de gobierno. El atractivo principal de la historia lo encontr√©, como tal, en el planeta Dune (Arrakis), en su historia y su ecolog√≠a. Aunque s√≠ me gustaron ciertos personajes (como el Duque Leto y Paul), ninguno se me hizo muy memorable.

Al final, este libro te deja queriendo leer inmediatamente el segundo.

It's hard for a book to keep my attention for almost 800 pages but dune has done just that. Some science fiction books get to wrapped up in their own languages and cultures but dune had just enough of that to keep you involved without overdoing it. It helped that it had its own dictionary in the back if you got confused. I'd highly recommend this book. Action, adventure, space, family, and a mild love story. I'm very happy with this book and will be continuing onto the rest of the series.

Pues bueno, aqu√≠ esta, la esperada rese√±a de esta obra cl√°sica ya de culto en la ciencia ficci√≥n, y esperada por mi sobretodo porque lo empec√© en Septiembre de 2020‚Ä¶ Pero empecemos por el principio, como supongo que ya casi todos sabr√°n de que va la historia, no hace falta que ponga una sinopsis, pero hare un peque√±o resumen a mi manera.

Estamos en el futuro, el universo conocido esta partido por un gran n√∫mero de casas feudales unidas a un gran organismo llamado el Landsraad. Una de esas grandes casas es la Casa de los Atreides, los cuales van a recibir del Emperador de la Humanidad (no, no el de Warhammer) el feudo de Arrakis, tambi√©n conocido como Dune, con todos los privilegios que eso conlleva, como ser los encargados de la melange, una especia que solo nace en este planeta y que es muy codiciada en el universo. El problema es que la Casa de los Harkonnen, enemigos ac√©rrimos de los Atreides, eran los que llevaban el cotarro con el negocio de la especia, y ahora deben abandonar el feudo para los nuevos propietarios. Pero los Harkonnen no van a dejar las cosas as√≠ como as√≠ y traman un arriesgado y complicado plan para quitarse de en medio a los Atreides sin provocar al Landsraad, lo que no saben es que hay mucho m√°s en juego, y hay planes dentro de otros planes dentro de otros‚Ä¶

Vamos, un Juego de Tronos en toda regla (no me pod√≠a resistir). Debo confesar que la primera mitad de libro se me hizo durito, de ah√≠ que haya tardado tanto en leerlo, adem√°s de cosas propias sin justificaci√≥n de este quien escribe la rese√±a. Sobretodo hay varios factores que hicieron que mi lectura sufriera un poco. Uno, saberse m√°s o menos la historia de la primera mitad, esto es cosa m√≠a pero m√°s o menos conoc√≠a lo que pasar√≠a hasta un punto en concreto de la historia y provoco esa lentitud. Y sabiendo que dentro de nada saldr√° la famosa pel√≠cula de Denis Villeneuve y espero que Dune se convierta en una franquicia exitosa habr√° gente que lea el libro luego de ver la pel√≠cula y puede que tambi√©n les pase lo mismo. En mi opini√≥n la parte de los Atreides en Arrakis afianz√°ndose y preparando el terreno antes de que estalle todo se me hizo bastante pesado, y no ser√° por la complejidad, puesto que mi parte favorita del libro son los entramados pol√≠ticos, pero la narraci√≥n algo espesa de Herbert no ayuda en el dinamismo.






¬øPero entonces porque tiene un cuatro? Porque en un punto en concreto del libro, la historia hace un giro y ya me ten√≠a enganchado hasta terminarlo. Quien se haya le√≠do el libro sabr√° m√°s o menos del momento del que hablo, digamos que la historia pega un salto temporal y las cosas cambian mucho a como nos hab√≠an presentado. Ah√≠ el libro me gano, y cuando pensaba que no subir√≠a de las tres estrellas, me tuvo agarrado al asiento como quien dice. Tambi√©n mentir√≠a si no dijera que el hecho de que la pel√≠cula se estrene m√°s pronto que tarde en Espa√±a ha ayudado a que me diera prisa con el librito para tenerlo terminado para cuando vaya al cine. Que Villeneuve es mucho Villeneuve, si no verse Blade Runner 2049.

Dune es una obra dif√≠cil de clasificar. Ha influenciado a muchos autores y muchas historias no hubieran visto la luz sin la obra de Frank Herbert (como pueden ser Star Wars, Canci√≥n de Hielo y Fuego, etc). Es compleja, profunda, llena de simbolismos, mensajes ecol√≥gicos, religiosos, pol√≠ticos. Sin duda ha envejecido muy bien, teniendo en cuenta que es de los a√±os 60, y se lee como un libro de hoy en d√≠a (quitando como mencione lo √°spero que me resulto su narraci√≥n en la primera mitad). Fundaci√≥n por ejemplo solo tiene diez a√±os menos, y a m√≠ se me atraganto, y lo que fui a buscar en esa obra de Asimov lo encontr√© en esta. Donde tenemos un Imperio en decadencia, facciones tan interesantes como las Bene Gesserit, la Cofrad√≠a Espacial, la CHOAM, todo el asunto de las casas feudales y esa especie de paz artificial creada para satisfacer el statu quo de los intereses de las potencias en juego, que Arrakis va a desestabilizar, quiz√°s con resultados nefastos para todos.




No quiero ahondar mucho en el argumento en si porque es una experiencia que cada uno debe descubrir, pero obviamente ahondare un poco m√°s en ciertas cosas que me han gustado y otras que no tanto. Los personajes por ejemplo, todos tienen su desarrollo, sus virtudes y son diferentes unos de otros y evolucionan. Paul Atreides como un joven prometedor que tiene en sus manos el destino de muchos, Leto Atreides, la Dama Jessica (personaje femenino fuerte e independiente ya en los sesenta), Thufir Hawat, Gurney Halleck y su Basilet. Eso en lo que respecta a los Atreides, luego tenemos a los Fremen, esos n√≥madas del desierto invencibles y que son la clave en el asunto. Stilgar sin duda seria el que m√°s me ha gustado, porque realmente no hay muchos fremen con voz y voto. Y sin duda, una de mis favoritas y que sale menos de lo me gustar√≠a, como es Santa Alia del Cuchillo, tengo ganas de leer los siguientes libros solo por este personaje.

En cambio me hubiera gustado ver m√°s sobre el punto de vista de los Harkonnen, las pocos cap√≠tulos que les tenemos de protagonistas me encantaron. Son los malos si, y ah√≠ radica la gracia y tambi√©n para haber tenido un coctel diferente de los Atreides. Ese gordo aberrante de Vladimir Harkonnen, frio, calculador, desquiciado y sin ninguna moralidad. La Bestia Rabban que solo aparece en un capitulo y sanseacab√≥ (en la peli tiene pinta de que tendr√° m√°s importancia, al interpretarlo Dave Bautista). Y Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, un personaje muy interesante, quiz√°s el punto m√°s gris entre los Harkonnen, personaje que s√≠ que creo que cumple muy bien su papel en la trama y no esta desaprovechado. Pero digamos que me quede con ganas de m√°s de estos tipejos. Por ejemplo, Martin y sus Lannister, beben mucho de los Harkonnen como casa contrincante de los protagonistas, pero aqu√≠ el tito Martin s√≠ creo que supera a Herbert, puesto que le da un protagonismo a los Lannister que incluso eclipsa al de los Stark (los ‚Äúbuenos‚Äù), al menos yo prefiero a los Lannister, son m√°s divertidos y complejos. Aun as√≠, entiendo que Herbert tampoco quer√≠a saturar la historia y supongo que lo que tenemos es m√°s que suficiente. Tambi√©n hubiera molado ver m√°s a los Sardaukar en acci√≥n, esa elite de guerreros temibles y sanguinarios del Emperador, pero como digo, son criticas menores.



En resumidas cuentas, Dune es una obra que pese a su inicio lento y farragoso, en cuanto te pilla, no te suelta. Con una gran construcci√≥n de mundo, que da la sensaci√≥n sin duda de que no todo ha cabido en este libro, si no que en los siguientes sabremos mucho m√°s de este gran universo y que en este primer libro solo hemos vislumbrado la mitad de √©l. Y que cuenta una historia que esta m√°s de actualidad con nuestros tiempos que con los de Frank Herbert, quien lo dir√≠a, al final todo el tema de la Yihad y el an√°lisis tan profundo sobre el fanatismo religioso puede a m√°s de uno llamarle la atenci√≥n.
Aunque como digo, aqu√≠ encontraras de todo, aventuras, politiqueo, ecolog√≠a, ciencia ficci√≥n, sentido de la maravilla, personajes grises, y una lucha entre dos casas enemigas que desembocara en un conflicto mucho mayor. Preparen los destiltrajes, p√≥nganse correctamente bien la capucha y agarren fuerte sus crys, que nos vamos de acampada a las dunas de Arrakis, y si escuch√°is un siseo, y observ√°is a un gran gusano de las arenas, bueno, espero que sep√°is volar.

This is a masterpiece of world building. Admittedly, this will not appeal to everyone.

Does the world need another Dune review? I very much doubt it needs mine but that never stopped me before, saturation be damned!

Dune. A single word that conjures images of sandworms, spice wars, great battles between rival dynastic families and a massively detailed and intricately crafted universe. No wonder this is widely regarded as not just a Science Fiction masterpiece, but a literary achievement as well.

The appeal of Dune is peculiar. All authors create little worlds in their stories but Herbert created a world. He doesn't just say that Arrakis is a desert planet, he engrosses himself and the reader into the geology. We get a new planet, and while it's obvious that the author based his desert planet on real sights and cultures, it's still awesome. The Fremen and their culture, the stillsuits, the worms, the plight for water... It's all explained in such a vivid detail without being boring or repetitive. And while reading you can see the references!

Is it space opera? Is it political commentary? Is it philosophical exploration? Is it fantasy? _Dune_ is all of these things and possibly more. One thing I do know: it's a I highly recommend it to any and all. I must admit that there is the occasional infelicity in some of Herbert's prose (and a too-heavy reliance on inner monologues to either state the obvious or convey information to the reader), but overall I can forgive him this for having crafted such an excellent tale. Woven into the story of a tottering space empire are real questions about ecology, responsibility and human life that are well-worth thinking about. Politics is not just a veneer, but the lifeblood of this story and, to me at least, it makes it all the more exciting.

All of these incredibly ambitious elements are all tightly woven together. Take out one element and the story loses its cohesion. Despite all the ridiculous amounts of detail there is nothing extraneous in this novel.

I love this book. This was my first re-read of the classic that I'm sure I'll visit with again a few times down the road. But I shouldn't have waited 20 years. This book is too good to go that long without reading again.

How can I do it justice in a review? I can say, "it's cool", but that doesn't come close. Even a 5-star rating seems to be short of expressing its worth. This is one of those books that should be allowed a 6th star.

I can't even pin down what it is exactly that makes this stand out. Sure, it's got great literary elements, likable and sympathetic heroes, wickedly delicious villains, awesome "monsters" in the sandworms, a science fiction technology system that makes sense. It has epic "universe building", a plausible "magic" system in the Bene Gesserit sisterhood. It has old style swordplay and futuristic intergalactic scope.

I've always said it's a science fiction that reads like a fantasy. The technology is truly secondary. Once everyone gets to Arrakis, the fantastic elements take over.

Herbert's prose is what makes the difference, I think. He tells an engaging story with an easy going clear language. His work is layered and has so much in it: philosophy, religion, science, morality, loyalty, cruelty, politics, espionage. It leaves the reader thinking long after closing the book. Reading Herbert makes me feel like I've learned something yet all the while I was being entertained.

I don't know where to start with this book and explaining it to anyone, it's clearly a masterpiece.

It was first published in 1965, it's just way ahead of it's time; nothing like I've read from the 60s before and nothing like I've ever read before in general.

God knows how long it took the author to write this, you can definitely tell it's carefully written; it's just full of depth, details of the characters and surroundings.

There's a lot of politics in this book, which doesn't interest me much and it does drag from time to time but it doesn't stop me one bit from giving it a top rating because like I said - it's just a masterpiece and the writing is genius.

Personally I think to fully digest this book, it has to be read two or three times because it is the most complex book I've ever read; if you've read it you'll know exactly what I mean.

I'm aware of the mixed reviews on the sequels, so I'm a little weary of continuing; what's your opinion on them?

I read it twice.
After reading the following books I can not say any more is my favorite sci~fi book. I am a little disappointed with the development of the plot in the following saga
It is difficult to connect with the characters due to their inhumanity. My best characters are Chani and Irulan
Arrakis is a very interesting planet, a background for a story full of drama, politics, vendetta, religion and more.

I haven't read this for many years and was surprised at how little of the details of the story I remembered, the general synopsis yes, but the finer details no.
So although I knew I was going to enjoy re-reading it, it was actually more enjoyable and entrancing than I had anticipated

Since I got into reading (about 3 years now), this book always came up. Whether on YouTube or Goodreads. I always wanted to read it, but always thought, from what I saw other reviewers saying, that it is very hard to follow and quite confusing. So I dropped the idea.
Then the Villenueve movie came out. It looked really good (and since this guy directed Blade Runner 2049, it was practically guaranteed to at least be a good story).
I liked the movie. It gave a good sense of immorality, politics and identity. I found myself being a bit bored at times, I think for the reason that I was kind of confused. Like, where was the world building?
I wasn't planning on reading this, at least until the next movie came out, but a fellow Goodreads friend told me you'll love the movie more if you read the book (thanks Allison). I saw it at a store, and listened to her advice.
And oh brother, am I glad I did.

Right off the bat, I knew this would at least be a three star read. The politics were interesting and the world was mysterious. Some said the start was confusing, which I totally get, though understood what was happening because I had already watched the movie. B even though I watched the film before hand, I still enjoyed it as if I never had. I'm actually glad I did, because I didn't feel lost like so many other readers seem to be.
The movie starts exactly like the book, just dumping you into the world, no world building or nothing (though this certainly doesn't stay that way for long). Now that I think about it, there really wasn't a time where Herbert info-dumped, yet I knew the world as well as I could. That is talent, and something I love in Sci-Fi.

The setting is perfect. Seriously. Anything desert related, whether it be movies or books, I love. Especially now that it is set in the future. Water is sparse. They can't even cry...ah! I love it. Herbert created a very fascinating indigenous group, and also somehow found a way for me to feel anxious while I was reading.
Water! Don't run out of water!
The Fremen seemed so in control of everything, but honestly I think I would hang myself if I had to live in that tribe. The thought of not having water is so scary. And I need showers, else I could, quite literally, go bonkers.

"Deep in the human unconsciousness is a pervasive need for a logical universe that
makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic"
-"The Sayings of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan.

The Harkonnens were awesome enemies. The Baron was so gross, though. Which I guess is a good trait in a villain. They really did him well in the film (can we please appreciate that acting and make up?!). Actually, come to think of it, the casting for the movie is exceptionally done. Rebecca Ferguson is probably my favourite actress, and I think she did a great job with Jessica, especially at the start of the book.
The characters aren't exactly charismatic. With that being said, I did still like Paul, Leto and Jessica a fair amount. The side characters might be better than the main ones. My favourites were Gurney and Stilga. Just know that characters are not the strong point of this book...


...unlike the world-building. Herbert created such an incredible world that is truly jaw dropping, as you know you haven't even made a dint in the lore and politics. It is just so creative. Very atmospheric and majestic, some of best and most impressive I've read. I don't really understand the readers who say that the world-building is non-existent throughout the book. It is very much present, and very well done. If you are a world-building nerd, you'll love this, as the world was just so incredible. Things like the 'thopters were so creative (as well as the sandworms). Such unique concepts, even to todays standards. That is another thing that is amazing about this book; it is very unique. Way ahead of its time. When I was reading it, I was like "You really just thought of that, Frank? Blue eyes? Worlds controlled by spice? Bug looking helicopters? C'mon, man." Really though, if the director does this next film right, they could become among the greatest Sci-Fi movies of the of all time. And plus the first one stayed very close to the book. Don't chuck a Peter Jackson on us, Dennis! Am definitely looking forward to it.

Before I get into some very tiny cons, I have to discuss the messages this book puts forth. The way it presented these ideas--through economical, political and religious power--was very thought provoking. All the characters in this book uses the above powers to hurt people for their own benefit. It is honestly disruptive when you think about how it resembles things in our society. How so much human suffering has come from political power designed to manipulate the people, as well as how some figures rise to power. There are just...so many things in this book to look deep into and discuss, practically begging a reread (which I'll certainly do at some point). But man, it really was thought-provoking, in more ways than what I mentioned (not to mention the innumerable philosophical aspects).

Two cons for me, would be:

1. The writing is so strange. I feel like I could never capture the setting or the scenery properly because it just wasn't explained right! Might just be me, but it annoyed me, on multiple occasions, how I never knew whereabouts the character were and what it looks like around them!

2. The middle of Book III was a bit boring. It took me awhile to get through it, but the ending climax was very much worth it. (Damn, Paul, why you gotta do Rautha like that?).

But, that's really it. I loved this book. I don't mean that lightly, I adored it. Those issue above are just small nitpicks, so I am still going to give it an easy 5 stars. It is just an awesome work of literature. Slow, complex and majestic, this is a must-read not just for Sci-Fi fans, but all readers. A book for the ages.

I'm glad I got over my fear of reading this book


Ever since I started reading again, I've seen thatDune had been a book that is a MUST read. And I've always been scared to pick it up because it's a long, classic sci-fi novel. I can finally say I conquered ! Unfortunately, I think I hyped this book up too much for myself...

Let me start by saying this: Parts 1 & 2 were amazing! Part 1 was a lot of getting to know the setting, the plot, and the characters. It had great dialogue, intriguing concepts, and an explosive end. Part 2 had a shift in pacing and was slower, but was fascinating to read from and got a lot of character development. Part 3 is where this book really tanks it for me. It was honestly gruelling to get through. It felt like I was reading a totally different book! I wasn't really happy with how some of the characters' arcs played out and I wasn't satisfied with the ending in any way. It was just a huge let down!

I really enjoyed how water is seen a sacred currency (priceless, even) in this book. The environmental topics and themes that Herbert incorporated here pose really thought provoking discussions and I loved reading about them.

The character in the first two acts were so engaging and I really cared for them, especially Lady Jessica. I loved seeing a bad ass woman have power over these men! BUT, for some reason, I feel that Herbert SEVERELY under-used her potential. Her character is quite literally one of the most powerful characters in the story, and yet I still felt that she wasn't used to her full capacity (maybe this is rectified in later instalments).

On that note, I wanted to talk about one of the common criticisms of this novel: the women. I've seen that a lot of people didn't think that the women in this novel were treated with much respect or that they were written poorly. At first, I didn't see that because Lady Jessica was first written to be this uber powerful woman. And then came the ending of Part 2 and all of Part 3, where the women just seemed to be concubines for the men, despite their actual power ranks. Even Chani, who is the other strong female character, gets pushed to the background in Part 3. How people talked to the women were starting to really get on my nerves! Just didn't make sense.

Another of the criticisms I read was that Herbert was appropriating Arabic cultures. And that criticism became more apparent as you work your way through the novel. The language, the societal and cultural norms as well as religious beliefs seemed like they were taken from typical stereotypes of Arabic cultures, which felt really off to me.

The last thing I'll criticize is the actual plot. When I finished this book, I was like, , which I can say is my own fault due to lack of research on if this book could stand on its own (It can't. It has an abrupt ending). The first 3 quarters of this book was so interesting and juicy to read, but now it just all feels like set up for the next books.

Anyways, this review is getting long enough lol. I hope that the movie can correct these problems that are apparent in the book. I still think this book does have its place in history and is extremely influential. While reading it, I couldn't help but see its influence in things like and even . If you like slow builds and politics in your books, then possibly check this one out.

Si tuviera que describir Dune con una palabra seria: EXTRAORDINARIO

Cuando los Atreides llegan a Arrakis por orden emperial para encargarse de la recolecci√≥n de la especia conocida como melange, lo que les espera en realidad es una traici√≥n y el ataque de sus enemigos en un intento por eliminar a su linaje por temor a que estos se vuelvan m√°s poderosos.
As√≠ comienza la traves√≠a de Paul Atreides, hijo del Duque Leto y la Dama Jessica, quien se unir√° a los Fremen, el verdadero pueblo de Arrakis para posteriormente guiarlos y enfrentarse a los Harkonnen y al mismo Emperador.



As√≠, Frank Herbert nos transporta a un planeta inh√≥spito, donde lo m√°s importante es la especia conocida como melange pero tambi√©n los planes para controlarla, pues quien la controle controlar√° todo.

Pero DUNE va m√°s all√° de solo ser una obra de ciencia ficci√≥n, si bien es cierto que aborda temas de poder, pol√≠tica, la conciencia, el conocimiento y religi√≥n, tambi√©n se centra en un punto a mi gusto, importante: la ecolog√≠a y el bien m√°s preciado en un planeta completamente des√©rtico, el agua.

El libro me ha encantado, est√° por dem√°s decirlo, sin embargo en algunos momentos he sentido la narrativa densa y pesada, por lo que decid√≠ leerlo m√°s lento, lo que me hizo dedicarle m√°s tiempo del que hab√≠a pensado, pero bien ha valido la pena cada p√°gina, cada cap√≠tulo. Cada uno lleno de reflexiones, de revelaciones y de momentos sumamente interesantes que te generaban diferentes emociones y es que pod√≠amos saber sobre cada personaje, qu√© hac√≠an, d√≥nde estaban, qu√© estaban planeando, etc, etc, etc.

Adem√°s, existe una gran gama de personajes con personalidades y habilidades que me hicieron amarlos, y si bien Paul Atreides es el protagonista y vaya que me gust√≥ mucho, sobre todo su evoluci√≥n, mi favorita ha sido la Dama Jessica, una Bene Gesserit, la considero una mujer inteligente, valiente y poderosa. Otros personajes de los cuales qued√© fascinada han sido Gurney Halleck y Duncan Idaho, y claro, el Duque Leto, pero no dir√© nada m√°s sobre ellos porque ser√≠a spoiler para quien no ha le√≠do este libro.

En cuanto a los Fremen, me han sorprendido bastante como tribu, por sus costumbres religiosas as√≠ como aquellas para preservar la poca agua que tienen. Pues literal valoran cada peque√±a gota. Adem√°s de como se han adaptado para vivir en un planeta tan hostil y centrar gran parte de sus esfuerzos para cambiar la superficie de Arrakis y que en un futuro
Y no olvidemos que tambi√©n son guerreros excepcionales que no s√≥lo se han enfrentado los Harkonnen sino tambi√©n a los Sardaukar.

De los Harkonnen y del Emperador Shaddam IV no tengo nada m√°s que decir que tienen mi odio eterno.

Y lo √∫ltimo que dir√© es que estaba m√°s que emocionada por saber m√°s sobre los , los gusanos de arena. Me resultaban fascinantes.

PD: ¬°Lea DUNE!

‚ÄúI must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.‚Äù

Dune can be easily listed as one of the most difficult books, that I have ever read. Under the guise of a science fiction, this book can easily be classified as a treatise on existentialism, philosophy, politics, region, war manual(?) I honestly don't have the capability to "review" this cult classic.
My only dilemma is

Should I rate this magnum opus for its sheer brilliance? the extent of themes and issues that his book deals with? all the philosophical discourse that forms an inherent core of the story? Or should I rate this book for the author's imagination for giving us this story, progressive to such an extent that it wont grow old even if one reads it in the next decade or four?

But, how do I reconcile to the fact that I hated the protagonist right from the very beginning? No matter how much I tried, I never warmed up to him. Nevertheless, the other characters kind of made up for my irritation towards him.

Will I read the sequel? No, not yet.
Why? Tbh, I didn't even get half the things, that this one set out to portray. There are so many subtle, hidden nuances within this book, I need to read it again, to fully understand it.
So a

P.S.: I partially read the book and part listened to the audio. The audio production requires a special mention here. Its one of audio books I've read till date.

3.4‚≠ê Updates Review & Rating
It's been four decades plus since I first read Frank Herbert's sprawling, shambling, quasi-mystical, soap opera of a science fiction epic. Any review of Dune the novel now has to take into account Dune the phenomenon. Three movies, a miniseries and numerous prequels/sequels by Herbert and his inheritors have etched this tale into popular culture. Bottom line though; it's just a good story.

Some main elements appear well rooted in western literary tradition, from King Arthur and Robin Hood (evil Barons!) to Greek mythology; others reflect Middle Eastern religious and political influences ( Islam and the Ottoman Empire). Re-reading the book made me realize how 60's it is and how it resonates with another science fiction classic of the time, Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land. That's certainly not to say the novel is dated, it just reflects the ambiance of the era in which it was written.

My older self has more patience with and more appreciation of Herbert's dive into religous and cultural themes, embodied by the Freman ( where younger me just wanted to get back to killing Harkonnens). I don't see any point in recapping the now familiar plot but clearly Herbert's vivid descriptions of his settings and his characters have kept his tale fresh for 50 years. Bottom line though; it's just a good story.

2023 Re-read
I stand by what I said in the 2021 review (above), mostly. But I dropped the rating half a star because Herbert's psuedo mystical ramblings about Paul's supposed psychic powers did get to be too much, this time. I'm getting old and cranky, I suppose.
Still a good story, though.

Non so esattamente da dove cominciare a scrivere questa recensione perch√® Dune √® un'opera talmente complessa e brillante da arrivare a fondere, in modo disinvolto, i pi√π sordidi intrighi di corte con temi di etica, spiritualismo e tutela ambientale.
√à un capolavoro. Poco da aggiungere, la prova √® il fatto che in qualsiasi opera fantasy e fantascientifica postuma si pu√≤ chiaramente sentire almeno l'eco della saga di Herbert.
Dune ha, senza dubbio, uno dei world building pi√π solidi che io abbia mai letto. I personaggi sono assolutamente unici e in loro si fondono perfettamente la tendenza tipicamente umana al materialismo e una consapevolezza, quasi profetica, di essere destinati a qualcosa di pi√π di semplice amore o potere o ricchezza.
Sono gi√† pronta alla lettura del secondo libro, pi√π che altro perch√© mi affascina enormemente il personaggio di Paul e ho la sensazione che Herbert abbia preparato una bella decostruzione dei leader spirituali e dei personaggi messianici in generale, nei prossimi libri.

20th book of 2019.

All the STARS!!!! My first 5 star book of 2019!!!

It was a long journey I embarked on with Frank Herbert. But it was worth it.
I loved Arrakis, the world building, the Fremen, little Alia, Chani's bravery and endurance.

While I had sympathy for Jessica in the beginning, I couldn't stand her near the end.

I will definitely continue with the series, but my brain needs a break first.

No le doy m√°s de cinco estrellas porque no se puede. Es la novela m√°s importante de la historia de la ciencia-ficci√≥n, El Se√±or de los Anillos del g√©nero. Es, junto con la Fundaci√≥n de Asimov, la raz√≥n por la que me hice psic√≥logo. Nunca me canso de volverla a leer.

Dune es una de las revisiones m√°s potentes que se han hecho nunca sobre qu√© pasar√≠a si nos dedic√°ramos a desarrollar nuestras capacidades psicol√≥gicas m√°s all√° de nuestra tecnolog√≠a. Es especialmente relevante hoy d√≠a, con toda la preocupaci√≥n acerca de si Google nos vuelve perezosos. Los personajes de Dune optaron por el camino opuesto.

Dune se sit√∫a en un futuro tan lejano que es casi inconcebible. Un futuro en el que las armas y defensas han evolucionado tanto que la gente ha tenido que volver a los duelos a espada y cuchillo... con escudos de energ√≠a. Hay seres humanos que han desarrollado capacidades de c√°lculo que empeque√±ecen a nuestros ordenadores de hoy d√≠a, porque tras una mala experiencia la creaci√≥n de IAs est√° prohibida. √ìrdenes secretas de mujeres capaces de controlar con la Voz, de convertir venenos en sustancias inofensivas dentro de sus cuerpos, navegantes que usan su mente aumentada por la especia (la mayor riqueza del universo) para adivinar los caminos seguros que gu√≠an a las naves por el espacio...

No hay un mundo m√°s rico ni m√°s vivo que este en toda la ciencia-ficci√≥n. Es fractal, no importa cu√°nto aumentes siempre hay m√°s. Religi√≥n, pol√≠tica, comercio, guerra, todo...

La novela se centra en el nacimiento de un mes√≠as en el planeta m√°s importante e inh√≥spito del universo, c√≥mo este chico trata de evitar ese destino y c√≥mo la religi√≥n lo moldea todo. Es complejo, es fascinante y es terriblemente humano. He puesto un marcador en cada p√°gina con una cita digna de recordar, y el libro parece un puercoesp√≠n con las p√∫as amarillas.

Si s√≥lo pod√©is leer una novela de ciencia-ficci√≥n, leed Dune. Puede que los siguientes 5 libros de la saga escritos por Herbert (POR DIOS, ignorad completamente las novelas escritas por su hijo y el otro innombrable) ya os parezcan demasiado chanantes. Pero leed Dune. Leed Dune y aprended cosas sobre nosotros como especie que no sabemos.

Y recordad que la especia debe fluir, siempre.

‚ÄúThe mind can go either direction under stress‚Äîtoward positive or toward negative: on or off. Think of it as a spectrum whose extremes are unconsciousness at the negative end and hyperconsciousness at the positive end. The way the mind will lean under stress is strongly influenced by training.‚Äù

Read my reviews from my blog:

Looks like it's a book almost everyone in my list has read. Now I feel really late reading it. It took me ages to finish it, but it was worth reading. I can see why it's great. We didn't have anything like this world after Dune. I really loved this book. It invokes thought so much. When I heard there's a special edition of this book is coming I just immediately grabbed it. It was really beautiful edition. I loved reading it. Though I can't say I re-read this book after I had already read it on an older edition. It's still hard to get along. So that's it. Don't say I didn't warn you.

Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, heir to a noble family tasked with ruling an inhospitable world where the only thing of value is the ‚Äúspice‚Äù melange, a drug capable of extending life and enhancing consciousness. Coveted across the known universe, melange is a prize worth killing for...

When House Atreides is betrayed, the destruction of Paul‚Äôs family will set the boy on a journey toward a destiny greater than he could ever have imagined. And as he evolves into the mysterious man known as Muad‚ÄôDib, he will bring to fruition humankind‚Äôs most ancient and unattainable dream.

Sabbia, acqua, veleno, occhi azzurri nell'azzurro

Dune √® quel libro che leggi sapendo gi√† pi√π o meno tutto quello che √® stato detto a riguardo, eppure leggendolo ti accorgi che non ne sapevi niente. Perch√© √® inutile sapere la bozza della trama, aver capito che c'√® un pianeta deserto con dei vermi giganti, essersi informati sulla diatriba sci-fi contro space opera o conoscere pi√π o meno i nomi dei personaggi.
√® quel libro che dopo 50 anni ancora ha qualcosa di non banale da dire, e lo dice in un modo bellissimo. Perch√© c'√® l'ambizione di voler intrecciare un affresco politico degno di questo nome, ci sono i personaggi, non scritti bene, non disegnati, ma , c'√® una grande lezione di ecologia, ma anche di umanit√†, ma soprattutto ci sono i . Infiniti dettagli, su qualsiasi cosa venga scritta, su qualsiasi pensiero formulato, su tutto l'equilibrio di un sistema-mondo. Ed ecco che esplode il potere visivo dell'opera, l'immaginazione galoppa, i sensi partecipano, e tu su Arrakis ci sei davvero.
√® anche quel libro che si perde un po' in un finale spiazzante, ma in fondo anche un po' affascinante, tanto √® insolito.

In generale, √® quel libro che √® riuscito a tenermi incollata alle pagine come una droga della peggior specie, come non mi succedeva da non so quanto tempo, tant'√® che l'ho letto a ritmi ormai appartenenti ai bei tempi andati, che dopo l'apatia post-Martin mi ha fatto di nuovo pensare "ohh, un libro degno delle Cronache!"... Che mi ha fatto battere il record di sottolineature, tant'√® che non so pi√π nemmeno io che pezzi abbia effettivamente preferito.

E se, tenendo conto di qualche perplessit√†, sono un po' titubante nel dare una valutazione del genere, le cinque stelle le metto lo stesso perch√©, cazzo, datemi da leggere pi√π roba cos√¨.
Meno teen-drama rivestiti da novelli innovatori di chiss√† che minchia, pi√π libri scritti con i controcoglioni.

Everyone who enjoys Star Trek or Star Wars probably owes a huge debt to Frank Herbert. Dune preceded both of them, and was the first sci-fi book to prove that sci-fi could appeal to the masses, not just a small group. It is foundation, and it fathered a plethora of copy-cats and sincere imitators. In that regard, I bow to Mr. Herbert. It was interesting enough to make me follow through to the end...I wanted to know how Paul would pull this off, where it would leave him, and what would happen to all those other interesting characters we began the book with. However, it is proof positive that this just isn‚Äôt my genre. I do not want, in the least, to read any other book in the series.

There is more at the heart of this book than just a battling galaxy or a struggle for control of a planet. It is about ecology, power, corruption, betrayal and all those other ugly things people are always either pushing or battling. It is about one class trying to control another, and it skirts the subjects of religion and spirituality. But, for me, it never reached the level of making any profound statements on any of those subjects. It was much like watching one of those Star Trek movies it reminded me of, a bit of fun that isn‚Äôt likely to affect you to the point of hindering your ability to sleep.

What can I to say about this one? This was some formative sci-fi in my youth and while the details are murky the sentiment was clear - I loved this as a kid. It's been on the want to re-read shelf forever but you know how it is with things you loved as a child. I mean have you tried to watch Dukes of Hazzard as an adult? You wonder what kind of a moron you were in grade school.

The Atreides aren't just some good ole boys, never meaning no harm (my God, what sort of a hole have I dug myself here) and Dune did not disappoint. The first half had me hooked and I would have happily plodded along as House Atreides settled on Arrakis. I loved the political intrigues, the backroom dealings, and the strategies inside strategies. I gobbled up the pseudo-religious talk and the historical notes and read it again as an ecological warning.

I generally don't read these sort of sprawling epics and even now I'm hesitant to read any more of the series (though it looks like I'm in relatively good hands with the first trilogy) Even if my time with the Fremen ends here, this was just the sort of indulgent clunker of a classic that I needed right now and can only hope that Denis Villeneuve once again manages to film the unfilmable.

This is one of those books that I've always thought that I should read, but never actually wanted to read, simply because I thought that it would have to be tedious and dry and, I hate to say it, boring. Which goes to show what a poor book-cover judge I am, because this book was anything but tedious, dry or boring. In fact, one of the first things that struck me about this book was the readability and fast-paced action and intrigue. So much happened in such a short amount of time, that I'd have to go back and read sections over again to be sure that I understood everything that had happened. Good stuff.

I have to say that I loved Herbert's writing style. It's deceptively simple and to the point... until 10, or 30, or 100 pages later when you realize that what seemed so simple and unimportant was a set-up for a revelation later, and your brain (or mine, at least) has this little "AHA!!" moment, and you feel so smart for figuring out exactly what you were so expertly and subtly led to figure out. Just imagine the possibilities for multiple readings... This book is one which can be read a dozen times and still reveal hidden nuggets of goodness.

Herbert's world, or universe, was so intriguing to me. I loved the political structure of having major and minor power families, an emperor, a 3rd party Guild to manage trade, and the 3rd party Bene Gesserit women, who sort of control-prophesy-manipulate to reach an end. The skills of the people inhabiting Herbert's universe are incredible, and so much based on mind-control. Not necessarily power over another's mind, although there is that, but I mean control over your OWN mind, to the point where instinctive reactions and involuntary bodily functions can be subverted and held in check, simply by will.

I loved Dune, as in the planet Arrakis, and the people who inhabited it, except of course for the Harkonnen jerk-faces. The Fremen are interesting and resourceful and bad-ass and wise, and are able to accept their lot, while trying to make a better lot for future generations. We could take a page out of their books, I think. We should be improving our planet, ensuring its inhabitability for as long as we're able (at least until the sun implodes and kills us all), but instead, we're polluting with reckless abandon, as if the planet is able to just reset with each generation.

Herbert's characters are some of the most interesting that I've read about as well. I loved that he infused a clear-cut Good vs. Bad struggle with deviousness and subtlety, and then on top of that, threw in characters that had to make choices that left you wondering who was real and whether they acted of their own accord or if there was something more... I loved the Atreides. They were, to me, the pinnacle of honor-bound deviousness. That seems strange to say, but I mean it in the best way possible. They were devious only to try to detect and prevent deviousness against them, and to right wrongs that have gone on for generations of animosity between houses. I do wish that there was a reason given that the Atreides house was singled out for this treatment, but reading between the lines, it seems that greed and power-mongering was the cause, and the Atreides were honest enough to stand against it, and so became the enemy.

This book is one that has a great many moral and religious and life-lesson undertones, which is a fine line to walk in any book for me, as I really, really dislike being lectured to. But I think that Herbert handled this all very well, and I was able to read it without feeling as though there was a wagging finger in my face.

Overall, I really, really enjoyed this book. The only reason that I am not able to give this 5 stars is that I felt like the entire book was leading up to a spectacular ending... but the ending drug on for just a bit too long and wasn't as spectacular as I'd hoped that it would be. It was a good ending to a very good book, but I felt that it just could have been a little bit more.

I definitely recommend this book though. It's entertaining and informative and prescient and timely as well as timeless. Just go read it already. :)

1st reread (also a buddy read with the World Beyond Margins group) in 2019
I can't even finish this thing in a reread. Part 1 now annoyed me a lot (Paul was an unbearable Gary Stu, I hate Bene Gesserit, fatshaming an already gross villain, dichotomy on women with logic etc etc) Oh indeed my older self became more critical compared to my first read (see below three-star review back in 2009). Even though I knew the ending I just do not want to experience 300 pages more of this, even though I did like the Fremen. But the question is that do I want to spend precious time reading about all the things above, added with the 'legal concubine' stuff? DNFed at page 210. One star dropped. Many books await me. Bubye!


I liked the idea offered from this book. The adventure and the sci-fi elements were definitely promising. The planet and the ways of living of the people to cope with the harsh environment were interesting.

Too bad, the characterization plus some of the plots were not according to my taste. Some were killed off too fast, the others were...well,simply boring and predictable.

The first part was awesome (edit: or was it?), the second and the third lost me. The final battle did not offer the highest dramatic tension as hoped. Plus, I found the philosophical nuances (and whatnot) a bit tiring. I wanna see more action, for Verne's sake!

To complete my rambling here: I got the feeling that this book is somewhat misogynistic. Not only because I don't like reading books with concubines in it, mind you.

But hey, since I appreciated the ideas offered, I'm still gonna give it a three-star rating. Doesn't mean I'm gonna read it the second time in the near future though.

‚ÄûI must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me.

4.5/5

No sab√≠a qu√© esperar del libro, tanto por su fama como por el a√±o en el que fue escrito. Aunque siempre escuch√© de Dune, no ten√≠a la m√°s m√≠nima de idea de qu√© se trataba porque nunca le√≠ ni la sinopsis (tampoco lo hice ahora, vi el trailer y me lanc√© a leerlo). Solo puedo decir que entiendo completamente por qu√© tiene la fama que tiene, me encant√≥ como no pens√© que lo har√≠a.

El Duque Atreides y su familia son enviados a Arrakis por orden del emperador, ah√≠ se viene una traici√≥n hacia el duque por parte de alguien que no espera. Todo est√° dentro de un plan mayor, pero nadie sabe qui√©n hizo realmente ese plan. Cuando Paul y su madre deben sobrevivir en Arrakis buscan la ayuda de los Fremen, personas del desierto que conocen el planeta como nadie lo har√° nunca.

Es muy dif√≠cil decir de qu√© va el libro, porque aun termin√°ndolo quedas con la sensaci√≥n de que solo fue el inicio de algo mucho m√°s grande. S√≠, pasan muchas MUCHAS cosas en este libro, pero al mismo tiempo son preparaciones de algo. Personajes empezando el camino al que est√°n destinados, personajes entendiendo su rol en un panorama m√°s grande y cosas as√≠.

Incluso el libro juega con los inicios de cap√≠tulos pues son fragmentos de libros de historia que narran lo que reci√©n nos est√°n contando. Muchas cosas las sabemos desde antes por esos mismos fragmentos, pero contrario a lo que se podr√≠a esperar no quitan emoci√≥n sino que solo la aumentan. Saber qu√© algo iba a pasar no volvi√≥ tediosa la espera, por el contrario, le agreg√≥ tensi√≥n.

Siempre cre√≠ que el libro era lento y denso, pero no es as√≠. Hay , es cierto, aunque nunca es algo dif√≠cil de manejar, por el contrario, resulta tan interesante que siempre quieres saber m√°s. En mi opini√≥n, la informaci√≥n est√° bien dada, no nos abruman con datos y explicaciones, ni siquiera en los ap√©ndices. Siempre es bastante amigable con las explicaciones. Por otro lado, s√≠, es lento, pero no en el mal sentido. Muchas cosas pasan, aunque son del tipo de conspiraciones, traiciones, rituales, no escenas de acci√≥n. Lo que no me molesta. Disfrut√© mucho el libro incluso desde el inicio. Dentro de lo mismo, las batallas no son narradas, nos cuentan lo que sucedi√≥ y para m√≠ est√° bien. Las escenas que s√≠ nos narra con detalle son las peleas uno a uno.

No es que el me resulte de por s√≠ algo fascinante, pero est√° tan bien construido todo que me encanta. La l√≠nea entre religi√≥n y ciencia es confusa, lo mismo con las leyendas y profec√≠as. No deja de ser un libro muy cient√≠fico, pero que entiende el poder de la religi√≥n en las personas. A los humanos siempre nos ha movido la religi√≥n y el poder de la fe en algo m√°s grande, m√°s que el poder de la ciencia y sus promesas emp√≠ricas. Aqu√≠ eso se refleja de una forma muy interesante, con distintas instituciones/familias/grupos econ√≥micos manipulando ya sea ciencia o religi√≥n para conseguir lo que quieren.

Ador√© al , en serio, pens√© que ser√≠a un personaje m√°s serio y d√©spota, pero era todo lo opuesto. Un equilibrio entre ser un duque y un l√≠der estricto y un hombre de familia y amante. Hab√≠a algo incre√≠blemente adorable en √©l y en las relaciones con sus cercanos. La tambi√©n me gust√≥, su disputa por ser tanto Bene Gesserit y como madre de Paul, su forma astuta de leer a las personas y saber qu√© decir para obtener lo que quiere. Era una mujer fascinante. tambi√©n me gust√≥, es un personaje complejo de entender por su rol y todo lo que significa. Entiendo que no act√∫e como su edad lo pide. Ciertos momentos desde su punto de vista cuando el tiempo se volv√≠a confuso y no sab√≠a lo que era recuerdo y lo que era una visi√≥n me gustaban mucho.

La nos permite comprenderlos mucho mejor de c√≥mo se ven solo por sus acciones o actitudes. Paul se ve de una forma muy distinta a todo lo que est√° pasando dentro de √©l, a sus maquinaciones, sus intentos de encajar y de evitar sus visiones. Lo mismo con la Dama Jessica. Quiz√° por eso me gust√≥ tanto el libro, porque pude estar dentro de la cabeza de los personajes y comprenderlos muy bien.

A pesar de que lo termin√© anoche sigo algo dispersa, solo puedo saber que mientras m√°s lo pienso m√°s me gusta. Incluso leer los ap√©ndices hizo que me gustara m√°s y m√°s. No sab√≠a qu√© esperar y estoy gratamente sorprendida con lo que encontr√© en este libro, se merece toda la fama que tiene.

I will say this straight away - DUNE might just be one of the favorite books I have ever read. It is undeniably one of the most influential Sci-Fi novels to exist and I will recommend that most people should at least try to read it - it might just surprise you as it did me.

I will keep specific details on the actual novel very sparse apart from a few great quotes as that is how I entered it and I believe that is the best way.



The very first thing that compelled me was the writing itself. Dune is contemplative by nature - it makes the reader think with every word on every page. The novel is filled to the brim with quotable lines that tend to stay with you. I was actually surprised by how much I liked the writing since I was quite intimidated by the book before starting it but it turned out there was nothing too difficult there. In fact, I would say it reads better than many modern novels.



The next thing that immediately kicks you with awesomeness is the worldbuilding. Dune is stellar in building up cultures and religions. It can be a little heavy-handed in the beginning with all the terms and expressions but I promise that if you pay attention and just let it all flow over you then you will deeply appreciate everything Frank Herbert has done with building up Arrakis and the broader world of Dune. The novel is also littered with awesome epigraphs that do a great job of giving you both hints about things to come and a better overview of things the reader has already experienced.



The overall journey that the book follows is magnificent. The novel is comprised of a lot of dialogue, politics, and tension but it retains movement at the same time. It is done extremely well in my opinion although if books that focus solely on these things rarely compel you then you may have varying levels of enjoyment with the work. I thought it was grand and seeing our main character progress through the novel was pretty damn interesting. Something that really elevated the journey for me was the use of the third person omniscient POV. I had some fears before starting my readthrough but it just works so well when applied to a book with tons of political maneuvering. It is really interesting to see what everyone is thinking in a setting that focuses on backstabbing and intrigue.



And with this, my gushing review just about comes to an end. There are plenty more things to say about this book although 99% of them point to the same conclusion:

It is a magnificent piece of fiction and will forever be a book that I will cherish.

Like many, my relationship with this science-fiction classic has changed as my life has progressed: too dense for me when first attempted as a young teen, by the time I was an undergraduate it was one of my all-time favorite novels; but then while reading it again near the age of 40, found a lot more problems with it than I had before, and more parts that made me roll my eyes and quietly laugh. Maybe this is why so many people over history have enjoyed the first novel but never read any of the rest of the saga? It's definitely a great book, for those who have never read it before: a combination of elaborate cultural backstory (ala JRR Tolkien), the far-flung future of humanity (ala Asimov's Foundation series), and a grand Eastern-influenced vision that evokes "Lawrence of Arabia," the original novel combines a Shakespearean tale of family intrigue with the trippy '60s elements of alternate realities and messiah-figure destiny. But yeah, let's face it; the older you are, the faster you'll be skipping over the pages upon of ponderous purple prose on display here, muttering to yourself the whole time, "Okay, okay, I get it, . Now what happens next?"

I really enjoyed reading Dune, I‚Äôd fall asleep thinking about it and dream of desert landscapes. I expected to be confused by this book, but I found it fairly easy to understand and follow. So if fear of confusion is the only thing holding you back, then ignore that fear. FEAR IS THE MIND-KILLER!

I didn‚Äôt know much about this story aside from: science, sandstorms, and giant worms. And I was surprised by how much I liked Paul, even though he wasn‚Äôt a character I would generally expect to like. I don‚Äôt want to spoil anything, but the similarities between Dune and a certain Disney movie is uncanny.

I will say that I didn‚Äôt love the ending. Frank Herbert did a great job of knowing when to take his time telling the story and when to jump ahead in the story‚Äôs timeline to effectively keep the reader interested. But the ending felt like it was rushed, it took too long for us to reach this point in the story, and when it finally did it was over in the snap of your fingers.

This book was hard to review on. Half of the team members hate this book so much they wouldn't touch it again. 50% of the rest half didn't finish it yet and finds it hard to finish. The rests of us finished it and finds it a great book with a great world, but not a readable piece for 2021. But all of us agree that we would love seeing this world if it comes as a film adaptation. All of us liked this world and the protagonist enough that we just can't help but wonder what happens next. So we all agreed this book should have 5-star on Story Doctor's Goodreads account.

Loved this to bits, but couldn't help remarking the similarities between Dune and Wheel of Time:
- Paul Atreides is similar to Rand: an expected yet dreaded Messiah, who has powers that are usually only available to women; also he is prophesized to lead people to Jihad (Paul) / Breaking of the World (Rand);
- The Fremen are very much alike the Aiel, tough and very good warriors, with sister-wives and a very united community (plus a slight similarity between Jamis and Couladin);
- The Bene Gesserit reminded me heavily of the Aes Sedai, not just because of the witchery, but especially because of the scheming.

Read it before, but second reading gives it 5 stars

First time you read this, there are too many things going on, too many strange expressions. You need to read it twice to see all the things you missed the first time.

Ljudi moji.

Iskrena da budem jako sam skeptiƒçna bila po pitanju ove knjige. Napla≈°ila sam se ƒçitajuƒái i slu≈°ajuƒái razne komentare toliko da sam mislila kako je ovo neko ƒçudovi≈°te od knjige koje ja nikako neƒáu razumeti.
Meƒëutim, desio se taj jedan trejler za film gde sam ja skontala da jednostavno moram ovo da proƒçitam ≈°to pre, tako da evo nas ovde.

Pre nego ≈°to poƒçnem sa svojim utiscima, bitno je napomenuti da je ovo jedno od prvih kapitalnih dela ovoga ≈æanra, pa stoga treba uzeti u obzir ne≈°to ≈°to je mo≈æda danas veƒá kli≈°e tada nije ni postojalo. Dodu≈°e, meni zaista neki mali kli≈°ei ovde nisu ni smetali, no nije zgoreg da se to i spomene.
Prvo, zaista moram reƒái da mi nisu jasni komentari ljudi koji govore da nisu razumeli pola stvari, da je knjiga prepreprepuna opisa i da stil pisanja nije ƒçitljiv. Ne znam da li je to do prevoda (ukoliko je to sluƒçaj, moj dubok naklon Zoranu ≈Ωivkoviƒáu koji je ovu knjigu preveo na srpski jezik), ali meni je ova knjiga tekla toliko glatko da sam samo u jednom trenutku shvatila da sam pre≈°la 500 stranica bez da razmislim o tome. ≈†to se opisa tiƒçe, pa, okej, ima ih, ali zar je to neoƒçekivano kod nauƒçnofantastiƒçnog romana od 700 strana? Meni oni nisu bili nimalo dosadni i naporni, a i≈°la sam toliko daleko da ne samo da sam proƒçitala svaki dodatak na kraju, veƒá sam i≈°ƒçitala i reƒçnik pojmova (mo≈æda po prvi put u ≈æivotu).
Priƒça jeste jako spora, ≈°to moram da naglasim. S obzirom da sam pre ove knjige ƒçitala jednu Sandersonovu knjigu, najlak≈°e mi je da ih uporedim po tom pitanju: Warbreaker ne staje, Brendon nas tu dr≈æi na tihoj vatri stalno i baca nas sa jedne na drugu stranu na svakih tri do ƒçetiri poglavlja da mi nismo ni svesni da je zapravo pro≈°lo nekoliko meseci. Kod Herberta je situacija drugaƒçija - on nam priƒça o godinama koje su protekle tokom radnje ove knjige, o svetu koji se stvara, o likovima koji se grade i sve to na neki miran pripovedaƒçki naƒçin gde, ƒçak i kada se desi neka akcija, mi nemamo taj nalet adrenalina kao ≈°to je to ƒçesto sluƒçaj. Meni to ovde zaista nije smetalo, no razumem ljude koji ka≈æu da im je knjiga prespora i da se ‚Äúvuƒçe‚Äù. Jasno je da je Herbert ovde ≈æeleo da ka≈æe toliko toga da mu sama akcija nije bila preterano u fokusu.
≈†to se tiƒçe likova, tu veƒá moram reƒái da nemam ni≈°ta protiv toga kako ih je gradio, ali da mi se
preterano nisu dopadali. ƒåak mi ni sam Pol koji je na≈° glavni junak nije bio simpatiƒçan, dodu≈°e mislim da nije ni bila poenta da bude. Likovi su bili onakvi kakvim su ih okolnosti i kultura u kojoj su odrasli napravili, i jako mi se dopadaju njihove meƒëusobne razlike poƒçev≈°i od onih najdrastiƒçnijih, pa sve do onih tananih. Moram dodati jedino da mi je u svetu gde su imena Halek, Leto itd normalna ime D≈æesika svaki put kada se spomene bilo pomalo sme≈°no.

Jo≈° uvek nisam naƒçisto sa tim kakav je finalni utisak ova knjiga ostavila na mene. Jasno je da je ovo jedan od najveƒáih zalogaja za jednog pisca nauƒçne fantastike, i da je Herbert ovde uzeo na sebe mnogo toga. Mnogo niti koje su protkane kroz ovu priƒçu a priƒçaju o raznim dubokim stvarima ƒçine ovu knjigu mo≈æda najzahtevnijim romanom ovog tipa koji sam proƒçitala. Dodu≈°e, finalni stav o nekim temama jo≈° uvek mi nije potpuno jasan.

Pre nego ≈°to sam uzela ovu knjigu, ƒçitala sam mnogobrojne komentare o tome kako ova knjiga mo≈æe da se ƒçita samostalno (odnosno, da nije neophodno ƒçitati nastavke kojih ima mnogo). Donekle se sla≈æem sa tim. Priƒça nije zavr≈°ena, ali je radnja romana zaokru≈æena u celosti. Ne postoji nikakav preokret na samom kraju, radnja nije naprasno prekinuta i zaista ne ostaje onaj ‚Äú≈°ta li ƒáe se desiti sledeƒáe???‚Äù oseƒáaj nakon ≈°to knjigu zavr≈°ite. Mislim da je tome umnogome doprinela sama dinamika knjige koja je, kao ≈°to sam veƒá spomenula, popriliƒçno mirna, pa samim tim je i njen kraj u tom nekom kontekstu miran. Ja liƒçno jo≈° nisam odluƒçila da li ƒáu nastavke ƒçitati (jer sam ƒçula da su dosta lo≈°iji od prvog dela). Vreme ƒáe pokazati.

This is my Book Of the Month- January 2017, with GR group- Nothing But Reading Challenges- Category: Adult Sci-Fi BOM.

This book was originally published in 1965 and is considered a Science Fiction Classic. I am very surprised that I hadn't heard about it before it got picked as part of a Group Read. I am glad I decided to go ahead with this read and if nothing else, this book is one of it's kind.

A future world, where there is intergalactic politics, mixed with some magic. Even though this is a future world, there is no major technology, instead we have feel of reading a historical book which is set in the future. This was definitely a unique way of writing a story.



We have 15 yr old Paul Atreides (the heir apparent to Duke Leto Atreides and heir of House Atreides) along with his parents moving to the Desert Planet Arrakis (also known as Dune) to rule and attempt to bring about civilization. This is where the real story kicks-off and one act of betrayal spirals towards a Prophecy being fulfilled.


It's for us to find out, what kind of Ruler would Paul actually be.

In Dune, Freeman are people living in the core of the desert. I read somewhere that the writer took reference from Tuareg tribe and Bedouin tribe to draft their living style.


Then there is the spice and the water, natural resources that play a very heavy hand and are responsible for a lot of major decisions by all the important characters in this book.

And as the story progresses we see that everything revolves around politics and religion.




--> The writing is really heavy and I had to re-read sentences to get the context in some places. There are lot of terminology that were new (part of the Dune world) and took some time getting used to.

--> The ending felt a bit rushed, Paul growing up years were kind of skipped and we reached the climax of the story. The first half of the book was slower. Maybe it could have been balanced a bit better.

--> Princess Irulan is the narrator of the story


Even after the above mentioned problems, it would be a shame to give this anything less than a 4 star because overall this story is really really good.

As part of the group discussion I realized that there is a movie based on the book. I sure have got to watch it now.

As kids, my older brother was a Dune guy, whereas I bowed at the altar of John Ronald Reuel‚Äîand neither of us could ever bring ourselves to meet fully in the other's territory. I have tried Frank Herbert's renowned series several times now but have yet to make it further than Dune Messiah, the succinct, but inferior, follow-up to his smash-hit series opener. Everything that constitutes this curiously prescient science-fiction champion appeals to me: an alluringly thoughtful and flush aeon-spanning back story; a desert planet from which is harvested the priceless spice that allows interplanetary travel; feuding and scheming noble houses within a middle-eastern-flavored interstellar Empire; human computers and gaberdine sects that have replaced forbidden machines; the super-cool , the soldier-fanatics of the regnant Padishah-Emperor; the young Duke with mysterious portents and genetic mysteries interwoven about his young stud self and his formidable mystic mother, and so on and so forth. It's all for something to scratch all those itches and stoke all those fires and hoist itself up onto the same level as Tolkien's epic saga.

Except that it didn't.

Every time that I have returned to read this novel, I marvel at how much the first two-thirds suck me in, ramping up the tension and tautening the various strands of the conspiracy-bound story‚Äîand the introduction of the Fremen and their austere, feral, and ritualized Neo-Bedouin culture developed amidst an endlessly severe and brutal wasteland is the most brilliant component of this story that has several. And every time I can't believe that Herbert put all of that thought and imagination and effort into this puppy only to sink it with that terribly rushed and anti-climactic ending. With whiplash haste the Baron is toast, his nephew is skewered, the Emperor is debased, the Sardaukar humbled, the Fremen ascendant, and Paul Atreides the smiling blue-eyed boy of the moment. It's the same undue haste and palmball that he uses to hopelessly mar the ending of the already flawed . The tangled plots and machinations and generational maneuvering and betrayals and...THE END! PLOTS UNRAVELED! BAD GUYS SMOKED! BLAME PLACED ON MEDDLING KIDS NOTED! NEXT!

It's quite obvious that I'm in the miniscule minority here‚Äîand I've heard similarly vehement complaints in a reverse manner from my brother concerning the good Professor‚Äîbut the palpable disappointment I feel at what I consider Herbert's lamentable inability to finish a novel at near the same level with which he constructs the back story and fleshes out the opening sections becomes so intense that it bums me right the hell out. What's more, with nearly every reader warning me that the series gets progressively more obscure and turgid the further down the chain of sequels one ventures, I have never mustered the will to crack the spine of , let alone the infamous . Ah, Frank, you brilliant innovator and miscegenetic culture breeder, how magical it have been if only you had the moxie to finish what you started.

2021 reread

It's been a decade since I last read this book, but I wanted to revisit it before the upcoming film. I'll tell you up front, I'm probably not an unbiased reviewer when it comes to Dune. I love it. I also have a lot of nostalgia for it because my husband and I read it together when we were dating!

So are there things that haven't aged well? Yes, for sure. Is it probably longer than it needed to be with uneven pacing? Sure, that is probably the case.

But do I particularly care?.... Not really. Honestly, it is in some ways a product of its time, but it's also such an iconic piece of science fiction that has had such major ripple effects. Reading the introduction in this new edition by Brian Herbert is fascinating and offers a window into the ideas and inspiration that led to this. It explores religion, philosophy, politics, and power. Taken together with Dune Messiah, it subverts the white savior trope in a way that actually made people angry back when it was published. (I'm begging you, don't stop here! At least read book 2 because there are seeds of his intentionality in book 1 that might not become clear until you read Dune Messiah) It may not be a perfect book, but it is a favorite for me and one that was in some ways ahead of its time.

Returning to this after a decade, I was surprised to find just how much of the book had really stuck with me in a way not many books do. This story and these characters have wormed their way in and I can't tell you how many times over the years I've thought of the litany for fear, for instance.

Anyway, I totally get that this won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I do think it's worth reading in a way that contextualizes the narrative Herbert was trying to tell. I'm still a fan!

I want to preface this review with the fact that sci-fi novels are not ones that I have any experience with. To be honest, I only decided to tackle this classic because of the film version having recently been released. Thought it was a great excuse to venture out of my literary comfort zone. So take this review with this in mind‚Ä¶

Going into this I had expectations of it being an epic adventure right up there with Lord of the Rings & Game of Thrones. Unfortunately, I was disappointed that it did not live up to either. The story itself wasn‚Äôt bad but the world building felt overly descriptive which distracted from the character building. I didn‚Äôt really feel like I got to really know any of the characters, which made me much less invested. Also, the story was not as action packed as I was hoping for‚Ä¶ actually a bit boring most of the way through. The ending was, also, pretty anti-climactic.

I listened to this on audio which was supposed to be multi narrated but ended up being a jumble of alternate voices mixed in with single narrating. This was extremely distracting and I think if the narration had stayed consistent throughout my enjoyment of the actual story may have been greater. Sadly, though the movie followed the book fairly accurately it wasn‚Äôt the ‚Äòepic‚Äô I was expecting either. So, overall, a pretty disappointing venture through all formats.

Dune, the first novel in the Dune series, is (in my view) absolutely one of those life-changing reads. The novel is wildly imaginative, set in an unique dystopian future and populated with some of the most memorable characters. Dune takes world building on a whole new level but at the same time, it speaks of our present human society. It is a very relevant novel that raises numerous questions about religion, power, politics and identity. As many science fiction works I admire, Dune asks the question- What does it mean to be human? Some of its characters exhibit or acquire superhuman abilities, but even they are often trapped by the constraints of human society and their own social programming. It is fascinating to observe the conflict between the individual and the society in this book so rich in meaning and philosophical questions.

Dune is the best selling science fiction novel of all times- and deserving so. It wouldn't be far fetched to call it the best science fiction work of all times. When it comes to my personal reading experience, it is certainly one of the best novels I have read, science fiction or otherwise. Besides the absolute fascination the world building presented for me, I was (and still am) deeply fascinated with the individual characters. The psychological portrait of the characters is wonderful. The power structures in Dune are so well presented and an interesting area to study. There are so many fascinating societies within this dystopian world and they are all well presented in the characters themselves.

Dune is a world of the future but one where technology is taboo. Space travel exists, but planets are ruled by feudal houses - all of them united under the rule of a single king. The emperor with the noble houses may seem at the top, but it is the secret societies that hold much power- such as the 'witches'. What is so ingenious about Dune is that all of this world building just flows with the plot and the introduction of characters. The plot of the novel starts when a noble family Atreides has to leave a water planet they rule in an exchange for Dune (Rakis), a desert planet where 'spice' (a mysterious substance that elongates life and hold the Empire together) is produced by giant worms. The descriptions of planets are fantastic and many interesting questions are raised in terms of ecology, the effect we have on nature (and vice versa).

Duke Leto, the patriarch of a family is a deeply honorable man loved by many. His only heir is Paul, a boy described as unusually small for his age (but very clever and promising). Paul's mother Jessica, a Bene Gesserit pupil, is officially a concubine to Leto but is treated and loved as a wife. The reason why Duke Leto hadn't married her are strictly political. The love that exists in this relationship will have many interesting consequences. The product of that love is Paul- a boy who is under a watchful eyes of everyone. Early on, Paul learns some important lessons:

Dune starts of a story of a noble Atreides family and while it remains focused on this family (or the surviving members of it), with time Paul steps onto the scene. Indeed, it is Paul actions that change the course of history. Towards the end, there is no doubt who is the protagonist of this novel. As the young boy Paul risks his life to acquire supernatural abilities, we see him grown up into a man determined to do what it takes to save his family and claim what is his. However, what is the price Paul will have to pay?

‚ÄúGreatness is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man.‚Äù


It is interesting how the characters that were created in this novel haunt all the sequels and sometimes even repeat again. Lady Jessica survives in the sisterhood, Idaho lives on in his gholas and Paul/Leto survive through all the numerous Atreides descendants. Although I honestly love all the sequels, I won't deny there is some magic at work in this first book in the series. It contains so much within itself. Highly recommended!

* I sometimes post longer reviews on my blog:

Questo, come gli altri di seguito, fa parte delle migliaia di disegni, fra storyboard e bozzetti, realizzati da M≈ìbius per il film di Jodorowsky, il primo Dune, quello mai girato.


Tra due grandi famiglie la lotta si scatena
sul pianeta delle dune, dov‚Äô√® la nostra scena;
dai loro screzi antichi nascon nuovi tumulti
e il sangue di fratelli scorre, dopo gli insulti‚Ä¶

Un'atmosfera da tragedia shakespeariana aleggia, solenne, su ogni pagina di questo celebre romanzo; l' √® ai livelli massimi, l'incedere √® lento, ma sontuoso. Tutto tocca Herbert con la sua immaginifica penna: la politica, le lotte di potere, i tradimenti, l'amore, l'economia, la famiglia, la fedelt√†, l'ecologia, l'imperialismo, la tecnologia, l'autodeterminazione dei popoli, la filosofia, la religione, la perdita, la dipendenza, il fanatismo, il lutto, la vendetta, la giustizia, la crescita, la tradizione, e molto altro ancora potrebbe essere aggiunto all'elenco.





L'opera √® divisa in tre atti, il primo sembra una grande partita a scacchi in cui i due giocatori conoscono gi√† tutte le mosse del loro avversario, o almeno cos√¨ credono, in un crescendo di che porta allo stravolgimento dello ; il secondo √® a mio avviso il pi√π debole, la narrazione si fa pi√π frammentaria e tende a dilungarsi troppo sugli aspetti filosofici della vicenda -leggasi: infiniti soliloqui del protagonista e dei suoi sodali sul senso della vita-; il terzo atto invece ritrova freschezza, merito anche d'un salto temporale di qualche anno che riaccende la curiosit√† nel lettore uscito spompato dalla parte precedente, e si conclude con un finale epico, maestoso e tragico.




I personaggi incarnano anch'essi archetipi shakespeariani: il principe defraudato che cerca vendetta, il traditore insospettabile, l'amico fedelissimo, la serva che la sa lunga, il padre morto e idealizzato, la veggente, l'usurpatore senza scrupoli, il consigliere doppiogiochista, impossibile non notare le somiglianze con l'opera del Bardo, specialmente osservando il modo in cui i personaggi interagiscono fra loro. √à tutto molto teatrale, soprattutto i dialoghi.
E ho amato particolarmente i dettagli delle tecnologie descritte e l‚Äôambientazione desertica di Arrakis, il pianeta delle due lune, Dune; mi √® sembrato quasi di sentire l'odore della sabbia intrisa di spezia.




Notevoli, infine, le appendici, pensate per tutti coloro che proprio non vogliono staccarsi da una bella storia.
In conclusione, m'√® parso un libro tutt‚Äôaltro che perfetto, ma ugualmente magnifico, i cui molti pregi fanno dimenticare i difetti.

While the ending felt abrupt and a bit unsatisfying, I very much enjoyed this classic of the sci-fi genre. Dune is considered the science fiction equivalent of Tolkien‚Äôs The Lord of the Rings, and that comparison makes total sense to me. The epic scope of Herbert‚Äôs debut novel, the highly unique setting, the near fathomless depth of the world building, the slightly stilted dialogue that lends the story a classic air, and the mysticism surrounding the central plot all reminded me of Tolkien‚Äôs world. Knowing how many books followed this one and dug further into the mythos Herbert introduced here further establishes that link. But what did for science fiction, how it helped propel the genre into the mainstream and show that it could appeal to literary readers, very much harkens to what Tolkien was able to do for the fantasy genre. Undoubtedly, the godfathers of genre fiction deserve our praise.

Going into this book knowing what it did for the genre and understanding that it‚Äôs a classic actually helped me enjoy it more than I otherwise would have. There was so much philosophy and so little deliverance of promised action sequences that I can see why plenty of others have been disappointed by . However, I try to read classics more leniently, with my focus on discovering what has enabled the book to not only stand the test of time, but how it influenced books that came after it. With this mindset, I enjoyed far more than I would have otherwise. While it is in my opinion far from a perfect novel, I can absolutely see why it‚Äôs important.

I found the characters interesting if often two-dimensional, but I found the world building and philosophy absolutely fascinating. I‚Äôm a sucker for religion in fiction, and delivered that in spades. Herbert obviously had a brilliant imagination, and I‚Äôm glad to have read this novel before new movie is released later this year. I‚Äôve never seen the original movie version, but after reading the book I‚Äôm incredibly excited to see this story play out on the big screen.

A buddy read with , , and !

with beautiful imagery and excellent prose, frank herbert creates desert planet, dune, and uses it to explore themes of human nature, morality, ecology, and systems of power. i really enjoyed this book. 'dune' perfectly embodies why i love fantasy/sci-fi so much: the political mind games, the genius creativity, the scope of discussions - it‚Äôs unbelievable how many topics frank herbert manages to touch on. i‚Äôm in awe.

primarily, this is a book critiquing white saviourism and empire. it gives agency to both the colonised environment and people by outlining the ways that white settlers exploit indigenous peoples, their faiths, and lands. i also loved the environmental commentary. herbert highlights the intersection between environmentalism and colonialism through ecological explorations. i loved that the setting was given just as much attention as the main characters are

i know this book can be controversial, and i think there's a lot to unpack with that. my stance is that the book does a fantastic job at depicting colonisation in its brutal & complex entirety. as frank herbert outlines: 'ecology is the science of understanding consequences' ‚Äî i think that perfectly summarises the heart of this novel & herbert's intention with this story

my only critiques are that some of the female characters deserved better (when is that not the case, though), and i have mixed feelings about the last third of the book. it felt messy to me (but i did audiobook parts of it, and that could be why)

on the whole, i think this is a mind-blowing sci-fi story that is unlike anything i‚Äôve ever read before. i would love to reread in the future and further pick all these aspects apart, but for now, i'm very excited to continue onto book 2!!

well that happened.

actually, i'm not overly sure what happened.

in fact, so much happened to where idk what actually happened.

what happened?

my brain, that's what happened. it can't make sense of anything complex.

this was a good book with good characters and good world building. that's why i'm giving this a good solid three!
I was just majorly confused for 75% of this book. And there was a stupid time jump, which i don't do well with reading time jumps (see Furyborn review), and that messed me up big time. Not to mention the audiobook cast. It's a great audiobook bc it has a full cast! but seriously they changed Paul's voice as he got older so there were like three different Paul's. that got me confused as well. Also the fact that this was written in the 60's makes it harder for me to read.

But overall it was a fun adventure when i knew what was going on. I wouldn't say it's a new favorite or that i loved it, but it was enjoyable and a fun buddyread w Gwen my twin <3

I'm excited for the movie and I think i'll probably enjoy it more because it will be visual.

I finally completed this epic sci fantasy novel! There is a lot of action and intrigue in this novel which certainly gave it a cinematic feel. (I'm very excited to watch the new 2021 movie, because I feel a story like this will translate to the big screen very well.)

Overall, I liked this story, but sadly never fell in love with it like other readers. It was incredibly tropey, and while I understand that it was the book created many of those tropes, I still struggle to get past how predictable the story felt. In a lot of ways this felt more like fantasy, with the space setting feeling like a backdrop. While I love to watch space fantasy, I rarely enjoy reading the subgenre. 

I am glad I read this one and would certainly be open to rereading it in the future. I hope it grows on me when I'm ready to experience it again. I know this book is so beloved and I really wanted it to become a new favourite.

[ESP/ENG]

No conocer√°s el miedo. El miedo mata la mente. El miedo es la peque√±a muerte que conduce a la destrucci√≥n total. Afrontar√© mi miedo. Permitir√© que pase sobre m√≠ y a trav√©s de m√≠. Y cuando haya pasado girare mi ojo interior para escrutar su camino. All√° donde haya pasado el miedo ya no habr√° nada. Solo estare yo.

de esta maravilla de la literatura, y me ha gustado tanto como la primera. Y con m√°s bagaje he disfrutado ciertas cosas a√∫n m√°s.

Esta es la historia de Paul Atreides, hijo del duque Leto y dama Jessica, gobernantes de un planeta designados por el Emperador para establecerse en el planeta Arrakis en lugar de los Harkonnen, quienes lo gobernaban hasta ahora. Durante el primer Libro (esta novela est√° dividida en 3 libros) veremos las tramas palaciegas de estos viles Harkonnen para destruir a la casa de los Atreides, mientras que en los dos restantes veremos la historia evolucionar. Habitando el planeta est√°n los Fremen, un pueblo que vive de manera muy tribal, que llaman al planeta Dune, y que ser√°n una fuerza a tener en cuenta.

El libro contiene intrigas, aventuras, filosof√≠a, y unos personajes muy bien escritos. Tras el final hay una serie de ap√©ndices que te retratan situaciones ocurridas antes de la historia, y un glosario con terminolog√≠a del Imperio,que nos sirve para saber m√°s cositas de las que se mencionan de pasada en la historia.

Si una vez llegado al final se quiere dejar as√≠, es perfectamente viable, pues queda todo bien atado. Pero si se quiere seguir, hay m√°s novelas para poder seguir leyendo. Una obra obligatoria para todo aficionado a la ciencia ficci√≥n.


PD: La edici√≥n que tengo es una versi√≥n del dise√±o que hizo The portfolio society, y lleva las ilustraciones de Sam Weber, que son una aut√©ntica pasada.



--Nota importante, se me ha borrado la review que ten√≠a hecha en la lectura original.--

Una joya de la ciencia ficci√≥n, uno de los cl√°sicos del g√©nero.
Tiene una historia muy bien desarrollada con unas pocas pinceladas previas de informaci√≥n, donde la conjura y las tramas palaciegas llevan gran parte del libro. Unos personajes que me gustaron mucho, que tambi√©n tienen, en mayor o menor medida, un desarrollo.
Me gust√≥ especialmente el glosario del final, donde te explican aquellas palabras que necesitas saber pero que te dan much√≠sima informaci√≥n.
Tengo pendiente una relectura previa a la nueva versi√≥n en cine, y le tengo muchas ganas.


---------------------------




of this wonder of literature, and I liked it as much as the first. And with more baggage I have enjoyed certain things even more.

This is the story of Paul Atreides, son of Duke Leto and Lady Jessica, rulers of a planet appointed by the Emperor to settle on the planet Arrakis instead of the Harkonnen, who ruled it until now. During the first Book (this novel is divided into 3 books) we will see the palatial plots of these vile Harkonnen to destroy the house of the Atreides, while in the remaining two we will see the story evolve. Inhabiting the planet are the Fremen, a people who live in a very tribal way, who call the planet Dune, and who will be a force to be reckoned with.

The book contains intrigues, adventures, philosophy, and some very well written characters. After the end there are a series of appendices that portray situations that occurred before the story, and a glossary with terminology of the Empire, which helps us to know more things than are mentioned in passing in the story.

If once you have reached the end you want to leave it like that, it is perfectly feasible, because everything is well tied. But if you want to continue, there are more novels to continue reading. A must-read for any science fiction fan.


--Important note, the review I had made in the original reading has been deleted.--

A gem of science fiction, one of the classics of the genre.
It has a very well developed story with a few previous brushstrokes of information, where the conspiracy and the palace plots carry a large part of the book. Some characters that I liked a lot, that also have, to a greater or lesser extent, a development.
I especially liked the glossary at the end, where they explain those words that you need to know but that give you a lot of information.
I have a rereading pending before the new film version, and I'm looking forward to it.

re-read 2023 | the woman was too stunned to speak

_____

original review 2021 | phewww this review will be a HARD ONE to write. But I really want to talk about this book so here goes nothing.

Only time will tell i guess, but this might be a new all-time-favourite. I went into expecting to enjoy it, but I didn't expect to be so swept up in this world and its characters. It's been a long time since a book was able to consume me (and my life) this much and on so many levels. It took me almost two weeks to read it but it was worth every second.

There's so much to talk about that I don't quite know where to begin, and I'm sure I will forget a few things, but let's just go. One of the first things that surprised me was Frank Herbert's writing. I heard a lot of people say this was a very dense, dry and hard to get into novel. I would disagree on all of those aspects. I have seldom come across a novel so rich in beautiful, deep and meaningful quotes that really hit me. The themes Herbert discusses in Dune really resonated with me, which probably contributed to my enjoyment of his writing and how he used it to bring his messages across.

I'm very much team pro-epigraphs. I LOVED them. Not only for the beautiful quotes but also for increasing the tension of the book. Someone may argue that Princess Irulan spoils certain aspects of the story within these epigraphs and thus takes the tension out of the book. I would argue the opposite, but that's just my personal experience with the story.

Now, what I really love in SFF books is when the setting is almost its own character. And that is definitely the case in . The ecology of Arrakis and the environment these characters live in make up a huge part of the story and I loved it.

Though Frank Herbert does only offer a rather detached view of the characters, I did find myself rooting and caring for them a lot. I really enjoyed the mother-son-duo that was at the forefront throughout most of this book and the themes of parenthood and family that were therewith discussed. Lady Jessica is such an intriguing, strong and elegant character that I fell in love with pretty early on. I also really enjoyed Paul's character, although I did have some difficulties caring for him as a person later on in the book. That being said, I appreciate his character so much for what Frank Herbert does with it. I don't think I have ever followed a character quite like Paul before and I loved the themes that were explored through him, such as fear, destiny, manipulation and leadership (and what that actually entails). People call this book (or the movie) a white saviour story, and, to me, that discussion makes it pretty obvious who has actually read the source material and who hasn't. To me, this book is a critique of exactly that trope and opens up a LOT of discussion about culture, race and colonialism. But that's just my opinion.

That's not to say that this is a perfect book. I found the reliance on fatphobia to paint the picture of a detestable villain quite outdated and unnecessary. While I think that definitely stands the test of time in many aspects, the way women are treated in this universe could definitely be discussed further and I'm very curious to see these female characters we've come to love and care about develop even more in the upcoming instalments.

Overall, I think this book is more relevant than ever and can 100% be enjoyed by modern audiences. The topic of environmentalism alone is such a huge part of this story, next to various other thought-provoking themes that I greatly enjoyed. is so rich in social commentary, deep and fascinating concepts and human emotion. I have been looking for a book to really hit me for a while now, and I'm glad I found that book in Frank Herbert's . I can't wait to continue with the sequels and probably reread this story many, many times.

Si no hubiesen adaptado Dune a pel√≠cula es posible que jam√°s hubiese le√≠do este libro pues nunca despert√≥ curiosidad en m√≠ y, de ser as√≠, me habr√≠a perdido una lectura que he disfrutado desde la primera p√°gina hasta la √∫ltima.

Dune tiene todos los ingredientes que para m√≠ hacen de un libro un gran libro:
‚ñ† Una trama perfectamente desarrollada, estructurada y cerrada.
‚ñ† Un complej√≠simo y riqu√≠simo sistema pol√≠tico, religioso, social y cultural, dentro del que me gustar√≠a destacar todo lo relacionado con los Fremen y las Bene Gesserit.
‚ñ† Es una mezcla perfectamente equilibrada entre ciencia-ficci√≥n y fantas√≠a.
‚ñ† Una ambientaci√≥n magistral que transporta y sumerge dentro del planeta Arrakis.
‚ñ† Personajes carism√°ticos y tridimensionales; est√°n igual de bien construidos que desarrollados, la evoluci√≥n de todos ellos es sublime.

A mi parecer Herbert introduce a la perfecci√≥n al lector dentro del mundo tan complejo que ha creado. En ning√∫n momento se tiene la sensaci√≥n de estar perdido o abrumado, dosifica y presenta muy bien la informaci√≥n. Engancha desde el primer momento y lo hace por dos motivos: el primero es que al principio nos atrapar√° con politiqueo del bueno: intrigas, traiciones, conspiraciones‚Ä¶ y la segunda es porque todo el peso de la narraci√≥n recae en los di√°logos y mon√≥logos internos de los personajes.

Y este ritmo tan bueno en ning√∫n momento decae durante el resto de la novela, poco a poco se sumar√°n el resto de ingredientes y podremos admirar en todo su esplendor la profundidad de esta historia y del mundo tan fascinante y rico que presenta.

Adem√°s, uno puede quedarse en la superficie de este libro o intentar bucear un poco m√°s y si es as√≠ descubrir√° que de Dune subyacen muchas cr√≠ticas: el peligro del fundamentalismo en todas sus vertientes, la importancia de la psicolog√≠a en contraposici√≥n con el poder militar o la tecnolog√≠a, el valor de la ecolog√≠a‚Ä¶

En definitiva, Dune es un libro absorbente y cautivador, de esos que merecen ser le√≠dos.

First of all, this edition is gorgeous. Stunning. Beautiful. Superb. Glorious. A thing to behold.
Secondly, this book is fantastic.
Dune is‚Ä¶ well, it‚Äôs epic! It‚Äôs thrilling (at least, I thought so), full of intrigue and so, so much substance, but it‚Äôs also very much an involved book. What I mean by that is this: if I didn‚Äôt read a little bit of it every day, I would be completely lost the next time I picked it up. There is A LOT to take in with Dune. The world, the characters, the language, the politics, the‚Ä¶ everything! It can be overwhelming at times.

The story sort of lost me a little as Book II rolled in. I was really enjoying the political intrigue of the first part (this book is split up into 3 parts), and felt it killed off a few of the more promising players. That being said: we‚Äôre basically told from the beginning much of the things to come, and there were dozens more characters that came into play for me to invest in. Paul is a great protagonist, but I was all-in on Lady Jessica. She is, without doubt, one of the coolest characters I‚Äôve read in the genre (male, female or otherwise).

This is book is a behemoth, and if you don‚Äôt give into it fully, you‚Äôre not going to enjoy yourself. Having seen the film from the 80‚Äôs decades ago, I kind of had a vague idea of where the plot was headed (from what I could remember), but this novel far surpassed all from David Lynch‚Äôs original film. I‚Äôm eager to see how the upcoming 2021 adaptation tackles the source material. It won‚Äôt be an easy feat, for this is a staggering undertaking. This book was far ahead of its time when published, and is a marvel; It was a catalyst for hard science fiction. Some would say it‚Äôs the father of all good Science Fiction. Frankly, I‚Äôd have to agree now that I‚Äôve finally gotten through it myself.

What has mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises‚Äîno matter the mood! Mood's a thing for cattle or making love or playing the baliset. It's not for fighting.

My problems with Dune are not issues with speculation. My disbelief is maintained through healthy exercise. Much as I am opposed to terms like world-building I can empathize and imagine. Pondering alternatives is a heady philosophical endeavor. That said, I do not like the insistence on the epic in SF/F. What I want is a Month in The Country or a Stoner on some distant world. Maybe that is why Dhalgren and Embassytown hold such appeal. I read the first 300 pages in a rush. I noted that it was the cast of Hamlet involved in the Battle of Lepanto and deciding to stage a production of Othello. Along the way Ned Stark becomes a suicide bomber. Matters sort of went downhill from there. I didn‚Äôt pick up the book for a few weeks and then blew through the remaining 200 pages in two days. Lawrence of Arabia imbibes a magic elixir and becomes Harry Potter and the womenfolk just hope for the proper man, both in prophetic terms as well as totems of identity and fulfillment. Wooden dialogue muddied a clever use of stream-of-consciousness.

Alejandro Jodorowsky was an ultimate influence on my reading. His unrealized cinematic adaptation was a superior vision to what was committed to paper by Herbert. Here's to my pledge that the inchoate will never be terraformed.

Ok. I have read this book twice. I have always loved it and acknowledged it as one of the best Sci-Fi books ever. I mean, it was written the year I was born in 1965 so it must be amazing! However, I never got into it enough to rate it 5 stars. I just don‚Äôt dish out the five very often.

I did a read-along in November 2020 with some friends of @jobis89 during the pandemic lock downs and this time I decided to listen to the book on audiobook. Easily one of the best audiobook productions I have ever listened to! I freaking loved it! ‚ù§Ô∏è So now - all the stars ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è for Dune. Duh (what was wrong with me). It‚Äôs a timeless Sci-Fi masterpiece.

Obviously Lucas lifted many of his ideas for Star Wars from the great book of ‚ÄúDune‚Äù, then simplified the content for a younger audience and their lower attention span. Which is absolutely fine cause I freaking geek out on my Star Wars like anyone else üòÇ!

So, now it‚Äôs time to kick back and watch the original Dune movie tonight - And I can‚Äôt wait to see the remake to be released in 2021 (stupid Covid messed up the original release date). And ...... I have all of the Dune sequels to delve into for the first time as well. Muad-Dib! Muad-Dib, Muad-Dib! üèú

Riprendendolo in mano dopo il film mi sono accorto che non lo avevo su GR. Ora c'√®. Il film √® bello e siamo tutti sollevati. Bene cos√¨.

The Good:
It‚Äôs a brilliant, evocative setting. A feudal fantasy environment complete with dragons and witches, shoehorned into a space opera. Great fun.

The Bad:
The prose is surprisingly poor. It almost seems like Dune fanfic. The dialogue is awful and it all feels very dated.

:
Paul-Muad‚ÄôDib is cold, calculating and a little bit scary. He is very much like Paul Stevens (played by Bruce Willis).

Richly detailed and featuring one of the most compelling central characters in sci-fi history in the figure of the messianic Paul Atredies. Herbert‚Äôs hugely influential epic plays out on a grand scale as feuding noble houses vie for control of the all-important desert planet Dune. Political intrigue, war and religion in the far-future, what‚Äôs not to like?
