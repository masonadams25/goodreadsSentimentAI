[{"label": "positive", "text": "\u201cThe Beauty of the House is immeasurable; its Kindness infinite.\u201d\nFirst of all, for those who - like me - read the blurb for this book, noted the mention of \u201cthe house with the ocean imprisoned in it\u201d and automatically assumed that \u201cPiranesi\u201d has something to do with piranhas (because ocean = fish, right?) \u2014 yeah, that\u2019s certainly not what the story is about. Regrettably, there\u2019s not a single piranha in sight.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThis is like a dream, slow, strange and intensely atmospheric, unbelievably immersive and engrossing. Imagine a labyrinthine partially ruined \u201cHouse\u201d with endless procession of interconnected enormous Halls and Vestibules, with bottom levels flooded by the ocean somehow held inside, and top layers covered in thick clouds, with enormous marble staircases covered by clashing Tides, and thousands upon thousands of marble statues.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not a dead world. There are birds and fish and remains of thirteen humans, and two living ones - , a man who visits our narrator for hour-long appointments twice a week on the search for mysterious Knowledge, a man clearly of the world that is similar to our own, and , although \u201cPiranesi\u201d knows that it\u2019s not his name.\n\nPiranesi has no memory of ever being anywhere else. . He is the Beloved Child of the House, worshipful of its beauty and kindness, grateful for the survival it allows him, full of wondrous innocence and remarkable na\u00efvet\u00e9 to the point where you fervently hope that he indeed loses some of that innocence before it\u2019s too late. You know he has not always been here. You know from everything he refers to that his world used to be much bigger than the enormous half-derelict labyrinthine House.\n\nIt\u2019s the story of kindness and gratitude. It\u2019s a story rooted in living in the present because the past is nonexistent, untroubled by the questions of identity, resistant to egotistical impulses - because Piranesi seems to know exactly who he is, the \u201cBeloved Child of the House\u201d. Even the harshest things that happen to him seem to have a silver lining through his attitude of acceptance and gratitude.\n\nPiranesi\u2019s acceptance of his life is quietly unsettling, his innocence frustrating, his equanimity troubling, his obliviousness infuriating, his kindness at times disturbing, his adaptability admirable, and his content lack of curiosity puzzling. And the further you read the more your apprehension grows. . After all, was known for his \u201cImaginary Prisons\u201d etchings - no, not coincidental at all.\n\nAnd so the entire story fluctuates between seductive and devastating, and remains quietly memorable. It\u2019s a puzzle and a treasure, fragile yet powerful, and a meditation on life in a curiously small universe.\n\nThe point of this story for me was not the mystery of the house or of Piranesi\u2019s identity; the clues are there and it\u2019s not too hard to figure most of it out rather early on. No, the strength is the strange world that Clarke creates so vividly that I felt that I was walking the Halls and avoiding the Tides and listening to the messages the House sends and catching a glimpse of the Moon along with Piranesi. His hypnotic voice - the voice of the timeless scientist - transported me fully into this strange orderly confusion and left me spellbound. And that was the spell I did not want to end.\n\nThe magic exists. And somewhere there may be a place where you can finally be at peace. Maybe. Depending on what you can give up. Depending if you feel trapped or free in your own personal labyrinth.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy Hugo and Nebula Awards Reading Project 2021:\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAlso posted on ."}, {"label": "negative", "text": "Umm, is that it?\n\nOk, let me start by first apologizing to everyone who loves this book. Obviously, I'm an outlier and my thoughts here are decidedly in the minority. So if you feel differently, please don't throw rotten vegetables at me.\n\nGoing into Piranesi, I had heard nothing but great things about it. How it's riveting and unputdownable. How no one had ever seen a story like this before. How the twist is going to blow my mind. Unfortunately, none of those turned out to be true for me.\n\nFor one thing\u2014and please forgive for saying this\u2014I just don't find endless descriptions of halls, statues, vestibules, tides, fish, and birds to be that interesting. I know, I can't believe I just admitted such a thing publicly. But that is the majority of this book! It was tolerable for the first thirty pages, when I worked hard to read and reread each description slowly so that I may keep straight every hall, statue, vestibule, tide, fish, and bird encountered. But I soon grew tired and just proceeded to read without retaining.\n\nAnd it wouldn't be a big deal if the only issue with this book is its excessive descriptions. After all, I've read plenty of books like that and still eked out some enjoyment. But here, the descriptions are in combination with writing I couldn't make heads or tails of. I'll be honest, I barely understood most of the sentences, paragraphs, and chapters, no matter how much I concentrated or how many times I reread it.\n\nSo what's the problem? Well, for me, I just don't see a point to reading like that. When the writing is such that it isn't meant to be understood or remembered, but rather just skimmed to reach the end, then why am I even reading it? Sure, I wiled away some time turning the pages, but I ultimately come away unchanged, and for me, that is the worst result a story can achieve.\n\nFor such a short book, this sure was a slog. Lots of readers report reading it in one sitting because they couldn't put it down. It took me three days of dedicated reading time to get through it. Every time I put it down, I had no urge to pick it back up. The only reason I kept going is the promise of that great twist.\n\nAnd here, my expectations were wrong too. For me, a twist means that the story is leading the reader in one direction, but then a development happens that takes the story in a completely different, unforeseen direction. Thus, the reader is surprised. But that didn't happen here. This book clearly leads you in one direction, and the reveal is exactly what you would expect from it.\n\nPerhaps if you didn't know the book's genre going in (not sure how you'd be able to swing that though), this development would come as a surprise. But it's a fairly common concept. So to prevent the reader from figuring things out early, the book is written such that it maximumly obscures everything. Keeping the reader in this haze-like, confused state for as long as possible is the goal of this story.\n\nAnd when we do reach the end, no actual explanation of the logistics are given. The how's and why's are just handwaved away. I don't mind being taken for a ride, but the destination had better be worth it. And it wasn't here. I expected creative and original, but I only ended up with derivative and unsatisfying.\n\nI know not every book is for every reader, and this one definitely isn't for me. I marvel at stories that take complex and intricate ideas and turn them into something easily understood. This is the opposite. It takes a fairly simple concept that's been done many times before and somehow manages to turn it into the most obscure and confounding tale. No, thank you.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\u2727 \u2727 \u2727"}, {"label": "neutral", "text": "I almost DNFed this one, and maybe I should have, but in the end I wanted to be able to fully review this book and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to do that only having read half of it.\n\nThis is a book that falls into a category I\u2019ve come to describe as for A Certain Kind of Reader\u00ae. Maybe that\u2019s a phrase you\u2019ve heard before, but for me it namely means that most readers will not like it, but a segment of them will LOVE it. If you\u2019re a Bestsellers reader, you probably won\u2019t like this. If you\u2019re a Book Club reader, you probably won\u2019t like this. If you\u2019re a Genre reader (fantasy, thriller, etc.) you probably won\u2019t like this.\n\nWho will like this? Readers who do not mind wandering around aimlessly through the first 100 pages of a 250 page book. Also, most likely readers who enjoy the types of literary fiction that can be alienating to the average person. I\u2019m not trying to be dismissive of these books, I read and like some of them! But I\u2018ll sheepishly admit that I sometimes feel like I\u2019m too dumb to understand other ones, and I wonder if some are so abstract and inaccessible by design.\n\nSo what\u2019s the deal with Piranesi? Basically there\u2019s a guy in tunnels? Or caves? That\u2019s just incurably confused and doesn\u2019t know it. He\u2019s unreliable as a narrator, but he\u2019s also extremely boring. The labyrinth he finds himself in is somewhat more interesting, but he spends most of his time studying tides or talking to birds, then writing it all down. Reading this was a good deal more frustrating than it was fascinating for me, unfortunately. I got about halfway and honestly did not want to keep reading. Yes, things are eventually uncovered and revealed, but the journey to get there was just nooooot worth it.\n\nI can\u2019t remember reading a book so short that was also way too long. I saw someone mention this should be a novella\u2014I fully support that! You could cut the length in half and essentially lose nothing important. I wish I had read the author\u2019s other book so I could compare this to it, but I have not. And based off of the length of that one and how long this felt, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m up for it. Additionally, was compared to \u2014I do not see that comparison AT ALL. I loved and and do not understand what the two have in common, except, maybe Clarke references Greek mythology? The writing styles are different.\n\nThat said, continues to have a really high rating on Goodreads, so who knows! Maybe check out some other reviews as there are plenty of positive ones to choose from.

It's excellent, and VERY different from Jonathan Strange (for one thing, it's less than 250 pages). Review first posted on Fantasy Literature (along with my co-reviewer Bill's excellent review, which I reference a couple of times below):\n\nI have to say I was a smidgen disappointed to get to the end of Piranesi and not have seen a single footnote (I\u2019m quite fond of all of the quasi-scholarly, tongue-in-cheek footnotes in ). But that was my only disappointment with this transcendent novel.\n\n\n\n\nPiranesi, who narrates this story through his journal entries, is the sole living inhabitant of a labyrinthine, half-ruined building he calls the House. He also calls it the World, which in a very real sense it is for him: he has no memory of living anywhere except in the House, which is an endless series of halls and vestibules, with no entrances or exits, where ocean waves and floods beset the lower levels but also provide him with life-preserving food, tools, and fuel. It\u2019s reminiscent of Jorge Luis Borges\u2019 , except with awe-inspiring statues in every room rather than (near)infinite books, as well as Borges\u2019 \u201c.\u201d Piranesi has found a baker\u2019s dozen of human skeletons in the House, which he religiously cares for, but the only other living person he has seen there is the man he calls the Other, who visits with him briefly twice a week and irritably quizzes him on his explorations of the House.\n\nTo paraphrase Winston Churchill, Piranesi \u2014 the character as well as the book itself \u2014 is a riddle (who is he?), wrapped in a mystery (why is he in the House, and what does the Other have to do with it?), inside an enigma (what the House?). I felt compelled to pencil notes in the margins of my brand-new hardcover copy of (\u201cMinotaurs!\u201d) and mark key passages. Note-taking did have the benefit of slowing me down and making me think more deeply about the layered mysteries, the symbols and allusions and ironies. Piranesi\u2019s and (when it\u2019s revealed) the Other\u2019s names, like Clarke\u2019s suggestive epigraphs at the beginning of the novel, are clues that readers may or may not want to pursue before getting deeper into the book. (I would absolutely love to be a student in Bill\u2019s class on !)\n\nFor as Bill comments, there\u2019s a delight in simply inhabiting the House with Piranesi. It\u2019s a beautifully described world, and Piranesi is a wonderful companion, brimful with good-hearted innocence, trust, and a joyous sense of wonder. His harmony with nature and his selflessness are inspiring, as when he gives up a large chunk of his precious store of dried seaweed (which is both food and fuel to him) so that a pair of albatrosses can build a nest.\nTo get too caught up in the details and the whys and hows of the ever-present, looming mysteries is to risk diluting the ability to immerse yourself in Piranesi\u2019s hauntingly beautiful life and world. When the answers begin to be disclosed, it\u2019s fascinating but at the same time a dose of the mundane, bringing the ineffable, at least partially, down to earth. The latter part of the book shifts tone to more of a suspense novel, with some heart-pounding moments of tension and danger. But then, there\u2019s a marvelous ending that brings us full circle, back to that initial sense of wonder and awe.\nIt\u2019s a testament to the power of Clarke\u2019s storytelling that those lines almost brought me to tears. is an extraordinary and thoughtful novel with radiant writing, illuminating our own lives."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "The Beauty of the House is immeasurable; its Kindness infinite. aka The Mind of Ellias is broken; his Soul fucking fullfilled!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe way I cannot begin to express or even put into mere words on how this book made me feel....literally immeasureable and inconsolable!!!!\n\nIt honestly felt like a missing part of a dream, sequenced away to savor and find for later.

The sea sweeps through the house. Sometimes it swept over me, but always I was saved.\u2019\n\nAn infinite labyrinth with an ocean inside, academic murder mysteries, many-worlds theories--Piranesi by Susanna Clarke has it all. This tightly written novel is endlessly engaging and so cinematic it feels more like something I have watched than read, which is blissful as I cannot stop thinking of the endless halls of The House with it\u2019s many statues, changing weather patterns, ocean tides and of course, our friend Piranesi surviving it all. It\u2019s a mixture of the show Lost meets the 90s computer game with a touch of and some pompous English academics thrown in for good measure. Sure, it\u2019s mostly plot for the sake of plot but it is infinitely fun and mind bending in ways that scratch all the right itches. A delightful meditation on belief and pursuit of knowledge combined with a boldly mysterious investigation into how and why the narrator exists in this surreal world, is a sharp and witty adventure you should certainly lose yourself in.\n\n\u2018\u2019\n\nThe story opens to the narrator describing his life in the House. It is an endless labyrinth of \u2018\u2019. These massive halls are filled with an eccentric assortment of statues are full of windows that look out upon the stars and the basement level of halls is flooded though with the tides the water occasionally washes up. The narrator is not alone, there are birds, fish he can catch and eat, and thirteen skeletons who he visits in a near-religious ceremony of food offerings and kind words. There is also The Other, an older man who roams the halls in search of a great power. The two men meet twice a week to discuss what they have discovered, though The Other may not be exactly all he seems, nor the narrator either. The narrator cannot remember life before the House, but keeps a detailed journal of his time there and concludes he must be in his mid thirties and have lived there for several years. The Other has named him Piranesi, after an Italian Classical archaeologist, architect, and artist known for drawings of fantastical labyrinths and prisons.\n\n\nPiranesi has come to know the House by memory and catalogues all he knows about it. He loves the House and feels it, too, loves him. \u2019 he writes. He looks upon the statues for guidance and in them finds messages of hope and strength. The House gives him food, gives him weather, gives him purpose even if it is only to serve as the inhabitant of the House. He has adapted to its rhythms, even creating his own calendar around the events of the house--the novel takes place in \u2018\u2019.\n\nThis is a novel where not much can be said of the plot without spoiling the really delicious mysteries and the carefully plotted ways they are unveiled. I will do my best to speak obscurely of anything plot related.\n\nPiranesi feels himself compelled to his work by a duty to science and understanding, though this differs from the ways The Other (and, as we learn, many others who seek the House) seeks knowledge about the House. Piranesi believes \u2018\u2019 He exists for its glory and for him that is enough. For The Other, however--and Lawrence Arne-Sayle--seek knowledge as a means to an end, for power and the glory it brings. While they claim to be \u2018\u2019 there is an aspect of \u2018the ends justify the means\u2019 which they will openly admit. There are many crimes obscured by the mystery of the quest for the House, which distort its glory to Piranesi.\n\nMuch of Piranesi borders on religious belief, though more of a spiritual belief in a natural world than anything. There are many pagan ideas infused into the novel, such as when Piranesi goes to one hall to see what constellations can be seen only to discover the statues appear to be arranged to stare at the moon which is perfectly centered in the hallway window. The date, as noted in his journal, is the \u2018\u2019: the summer solstice.\n\nWhat Piranesi has found in his comfortable communion with the House is, it would seem, not unlike the great power some have sought after. There is talk of the \u2018\u2019 when humans could speak to nature and nature would speak back and bend to the wishes of humans. It is believed \u2018\u2019 and it can be found again. But Piranesi, in his love for the House, already believes it communicates with him. He thanks it for the food it brings, for the shelter it provides, for all its wonders and beauty and kindness. \u2018\u2019 he writes, and that \u2018\u2019 His ways of speaking about the House as if it were a Deity resemble the sort of secrets the Other wishes to obtain but, in all his searching, cannot find it. Because he seeks it and does not simply live it, it cannot be seen. This becomes similar to protecting the environment and the way nature speaks to us when we strive for it. By having ravaged the land for the sake of wealth and power, we have nearly killed it and each other but if we listen to the world and live sustainably we can all thrive.\n\nThis becomes a novel about transgressive ideas, though not in the way that many originally thought them to be (repeatedly pointing out that Lawrence was gay solely to demonstrate all the ways he was \u2018transgressive in nature\u2019 is pretty uncool of the author though). While thinking outside the norm makes one an outcast, what we discover is that what they were thinking wasn\u2019t odd but the way they would go about using that knowledge and the means to obtain it. The halls are either a curio to be exploited, or something to cherish, and the meaning of them is different for every character. This book gets really sinister, and the way it creeps up on you is almost akin to horror aesthetics.\n\nis a wild, twisted and surreal ride that is unfolds so well by constantly teasing insight and toying with tension that it\u2019s nearly impossible to put down. The opening section could easily have been extended with 100 pages of him simply exploring the halls and I would have loved it, so my only real criticism here is that it was a bit too plot heavy when it could have breathed more. But I so enjoyed living in the images in my head--the atmosphere of this novel is fantastic and will bring you to such stunning places. This is a really fun and fascinating look at the pursuit of knowledge and how sometimes it goes too far and for the wrong reasons. A really worthwhile weekend read, you will definitely want to get lost in the halls of the House.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019"}, {"label": "negative", "text": "I rarely write bad reviews but this was one of the most boring and repetitive books I've ever read.\n\nHalls..\nVestibules..\nStatues..\nAlbatross..\nHalls...\nVestibules...\nStatues...\nAlbatross..\n\nAnd blah blah blah...\n\nSo goddamn boring, tedious and overhyped.\n\nThis is the kind of book that puts me in a slump!\n\nI understand I'm in the minority here, most people have given this five stars - God knows why."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "A genre-blending, memorable, and melancholic standalone novel.\n\nThis will be a short review.

There are two reasons for this. First, this is a short novel; I\u2019m sure you can finish reading this book within 3-4 hours. Second, it\u2019s due to spoiler reasons; before I started reading Piranesi, I received plenty of advice saying that it\u2019s better to read this book without knowing anything about it.

He thinks he\u2019s living by himself, all alone till some signs show otherwise.\n\nIt was truly so much different from Jonathan Strange\u2019s story. There is nothing in common with both books. So if you dream to read something similar from the author\u2019s previous work, you may be disappointed.\n\nThis book is intense, needing so much effort and patience to enjoy the symbolic literature taste and in my opinion even though you may see some resemblances with the myth, it\u2019s not a retelling. Its genre is also indecisive, mythology, mystery, absurd dark comedy and partly retelling genres are blended into was his other.\n\nIt is smart, it exhaust you, burn your brain cells but thankfully it\u2019s not long, boring or repetitive. It\u2019s experimental, fantastic, intelligent but also quirky.\n\nIf you like to try different, original tastes of literature feast from the pen of talented author, this book may check your all boxes.

It can be confusing and even disorienting at first, but it's a book that is very smart about how it is going to teach you what it is, so I recommend letting the book do that rather than any reviews or jacket copy.\n\nSo here's my totally non-info-about-the-book review to hopefully give you an idea of whether it will be a good one for you.\n\nFirst: do not approach this book expecting it to be anything like JONATHAN STRANGE. Like many people, I adore that book, and this is not like it in any way shape or form. The only way in which they are similar is that they share a kind of glee in not following the rules so that you do not know what to expect.\n\nPIRANESI is not difficult to read but it is strange. It requires a bit of dedication. It is not long, though, so it isn't the kind of commitment that you will have to spend days or weeks reading it bit by bit. While it doesn't have a real momentum to it in the prose itself, I was compelled to continue and read it quite quickly because I just wanted to know what the hell was happening.\n\nNothing is quite what you expect here. It is unclear whether the book takes place in a universe resembling our own and what relationship it is meant to have to our world for most of the time you are reading it. It is not a book with a lot of plot or character development either. It is, when it comes down to it, quite simply a mystery. Except that the mystery is the entire concept of the book, where it's set, and who the characters are. Mysteries that exist in a kind of fantastical world are not all that common, though, and it's best for both sets of readers to relax a bit because, remember, this book is not going to follow the conventions of either genre.\n\nMy experience of the book was quite delightful, even if, at the end of the day, it ends up being much more of a trifle than JSAMN. They are in many ways opposites, this one so small, a weird little bonbon of a book that is over just as it's begun, while the other is so large and complex, the kind of massive intricate dessert you do not want to eat because it looks so nice. But there are pleasures to be had in an unusual little escape, pleasures to be had in being baffled, and Clarke is more than competent to see you through this small exercise as she is a massive tome. It is, in its way, a perfectly peculiar beach read."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "Re-read for my book club. Still loved it.

Quite the POV study.\n\nThis time around, I\u2019d meant to read it instead of listen. But the audiobook is such a delight.\n\n\nPretty much anything I could write about this book would be a spoiler, so I will keep this short and say, if you like strange and magical stories, this one is wonderful. I loved it.\n\nI will also join my voice to the chorus of fans who recommend that you read as little as you can about the book before starting it so that you can fully enjoy the unfolding strangeness.\n\nFor writers, this book is a masterclass in point of view. There are incredible disconnects between the information of the world and the understanding of the main character, and each one is delightful.\n\nUpdate: It seems like this has become something of a love it or hate it book.

He cannot imagine why anything should exist if he cannot make use of it.\n\nAt the start of the book we see a quote from The Magician's Nephew from and some concepts from that book come neatly back in . The titular character and narrator (despite that he has an awareness it is not truly his name) roams immense and seemingly unending halls in a house. Twice a week The Other visits him and gives him some utensils that can't be made from bird feathers, fish, shells and seaweed (there is namely a sea in the lower halls, and various tides bundle together to a plot device in the end). Slowly but surely we learn more about the world and the history of Piranesi. I felt that skillfully employed the information drizzler and read this book in only two days.\n\nThe narrator seems to have an uncanny understanding of the world we would call the normal world outside of the halls he walks in (around 7.000 visited by him). I recently started a bit in and the strangeness and threat of never ending halls slightly reminded me of that book. In the end however I feel the book had most in common with the from , a book revolving around a person waking up with memory loss and slowly piecing together his identity and the strange world he finds himself in. And I was strangely reminded of the enormous walls in series as well, also a tale (albeit in a very different genre) about memory loss and a seemingly impossible environment slowly giving up its secrets.\nConceptually Clarke takes \u2019s thoughts about ideas and the nature of the world as one of the foundations for the worldbuilding in this book.\nIn terms of other media it reminds me both of the plot of Memento and the deepest layer of Inception of Christopher Nolan. In general I feel this book would work very well as a movie.\n\nIn the later parts of the book the novelty and strangeness of the world become less pronounced and the books goes into a quite a conventional almost modern fairytale direction (with some inversions).

It's a short book, but even so, I read it in only a few lumps in about a week. Which is fast for me. So, in that sense it's a page turner.

I wanted to know what was going on, and then when I did know what was going on, I wanted to know how it would end.\n\nIt was not a book where I developed affection for the characters, or was wowed by the twisting of the plot, or was thrilled by the action. It wasn't even a book where I was particularly transported by the prose. The setting felt rather like a one trick-pony, and I grew a little weary of statues after a while. I shouldn't complain about that too much, having a few months ago finished a book set in a possibly infinite library, I find myself open to the same charge of readers growing weary of shelves and books....\n\nI've not read any reviews yet, but I saw from the average rating and number of ratings that the book is highly rated and very successful. It feels a little peevish to complain about a book that kept me turning the pages and centred on an intriguing idea. But I must admit to coming away from it wanting not more of the book but more from the book.\n\nIt is for much of its length a gently, quirky book, that has some undeniable measure of beauty to it. And I guess I'm out of step on this one in finding it a bit repetitious, a bit long winded despite its brevity, and a bit thin despite the depth of its final line.\n\nCertainly a long way from a bad book.

The writing did not feel natural to me, I was confused most of the time and although it is a short book, it was hard to go through. I could have continued for a couple of hours and finished it but I felt that there was no point in doing that.\n\nThe writing is very \u201cpurple\u201d, I felt that the author tried too hard with the descriptions and she could have used much simpler terminology to describe things.

It's not his name, obviously, but that's what he's called by 'the Other' (Val Ketterley). The Other is someone Piranesi has weekly meetings with (I'm getting the nice and comfy corporate feeling from this).\n\nYeah, and all the capitalisation made me feel by this point like it was written in German. I do realise why his had to be done in precisely this way but it's quite irritating.\n\nSo, the guy, Piranesi, is stalking the house. He does that for years.

Pietrino, dicono tutti.\n\nIo so per certo che non \u00e8 il mio nome, anche se probabilmente ci si avvicina molto.\n\nPasso la maggior parte del mio tempo nella parte Occidentale della Casa, seduto su una sedia e catturato dal quadro che sta sopra di me. Due amanti si abbracciano in modo surreale tanto da diventare una cosa sola. La mia sedia scomoda mi sta distruggendo la schiena, ma questo \u00e8 quello che la Casa offre e io le sono grato. Mi reco fuori dalla Casa per recuperare i viveri, mi proteggo e faccio attenzione a non avvicinarmi e a non scambiare troppe parole con gli Altri. Loro dicono di essere buoni ed indifesi, ma sembra sia meglio non fidarsi.\n\nUn giorno sono entrato in possesso di un manoscritto che mi aveva incuriosito vedendolo comparire nello schermo di uno dei dispositivi elettronici che la Casa forniva. Mi infastidiva vederlo dappertutto, sul serio! Ma mi fido della Casa, per cui ho iniziato a leggerlo. Anche perch\u00e9 quale altra alternativa avevo? Ho scoperto con sollievo di non essere il solo intrappolato nella Casa e ad essere chiamato con un nome che non era il suo. Anche se la Casa era diversa. Pi\u00f9 grande, pi\u00f9 infinita della mia. Me la sono immaginata in bianco e nero. E anche il nome era diverso.\nIl manoscritto parte come una sorta di anti poema epico, in cui non si sente il bisogno di tornare ad Itaca, perch\u00e9 la Casa \u00e8 tutto quello che noi chiamiamo \u201cMondo\u201d. La bellezza della Casa \u00e8 smisurata, i mari sono intrappolati nei saloni circondati da statue di una bellezza rara e antica. Le colonne d\u2019Ercole sono identificate da due statue a forma di Minotauro, oltre i quali non mi sono mai spinto. Un bagliore lieve sembra brillare nell\u2019oscurit\u00e0 compresa tra le due statue, ma ho paura ad avvicinarmi.\n\nPoi a met\u00e0 del manoscritto il libro diventa qualcos\u2019altro. Un\u2019opera di fantascienza, forse. No, esagerato. Esoterismo, era quella la parola che stavo cercando. Ma tutte queste statue rendono pi\u00f9 luminosa l\u2019oscurit\u00e0 evocata da quella parola. E come uno sballo legato ad una sostanza stupefacente che sciamando ci fa tornare alla realt\u00e0, il protagonista inizia a ricordare e a capire cosa sta succedendo. Noi lo capiamo prima di lui, cos\u00ec come noi a differenza sua sappiamo perch\u00e9 siamo rinchiusi nella Casa.\n\nNon sar\u00e0 semplice tornare alla realt\u00e0.

The theory posits that each of these worlds is as concrete and real as ours, and ours is unique simply because we live in it.\n\nPiranesi, the eponymous character, lives in one such world. A world, that to readers familiar with Giovanni Battista Piranesi's work, will seem like a superimposition of his numerous labyrinthine etchings. A world that is also an infinite house - waves crash and tides rise up in the lower floors while the clouds wander around in the upper floors. This house is populated by thousands and thousands of statues, some beautiful and others strange.\n\n\n\nPiranesi does not reside there alone. The 'Other' whom Piranesi meets twice a week, also lives in the house, and together they are working on extracting an ancient, secret knowledge that the Other believes is trapped within the house.\n\nBut as the story progresses, Piranesi finds himself in a complex entanglement of questions concerning his relation to the house, the other's intentions and the origins of his world. To his great distress, he also discovers that there are gaps in his memory.\n\nThe book is also a study in solitude. While wandering the house's numerous halls, talking to birds, drawing stellar maps and making tidal calculations of the waves crashing together, Piranesi is utterly alone. But, he is also content. In this marvelous book, solitude is not merely a state of mind. It is life itself.\n\nThe book with its Borgesque prose that's also faintly reminiscent of Lovecraftian horror, is a perfect weekend read. I curled up with it and let the world around me transform into Piranesi's eternal halls and minotaur statues.\n\nEdit: I am so pleased that a fantasy book won The Women's Prize for Fiction!

My attention could wander among All the Capital letters, looking for Discrete meaning where there is general background clutter, furniture for The House. The House, you see, is the world. The Worldhouse is Piranesi's Place of Worship and Study, and is as close to infinite as Piranesi can conceive.\n\n\n\nLife is exactly what Piranesi derives from the House. In the Drowned Halls our resourceful cicerone catches fish; in the Coral Halls, among other places, he finds colonies of mussels, and immense floats of seaweed; so the House feeds him at a most modest expenditure of energy and effort. The glorious visuals of this book are like eating Sachertorte then black forest g\u00e2teau then prinsesst\u00e5rta with cheesecake for dessert. The headiest are the moments we see the Drowned Halls and the Western Halls, the latter with their Statue of a Faun:\n\nCould a clearer note be sounded to hark back to Lucy Pevensie and Mr. Tumnus? We're in a Story, laddies and gentlewomen, make no mistake about it. Not some run-of-the-mill novel, a Story, a myth made of sterner Stuff than a mere jeu d'esprit destined for an hours' pleasure. And like all those Stories we've loved and suffered through as we grew into our best selves (which, of course, we all have done like Piranesi has done), there must be An Other. Others are friends. Others are enemies. The Other, in the Story we are told here, is both and neither:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Other, then, is a Liar and a Manipulator. We see it, standing (more likely sitting, possibly reclining) outside the Story as we must, but our glorious cicerone does not. Or else why would we need his Story told to us?\n\nLike any well-made Myth, the story expands the House and the Other into very odd, very frightening sizes and directions. Piranesi is a Na\u00eff and we can't help but fear for him in his Eternal Present. But he is a scientist, and a methodical man, and he must needs follow clues and puzzle out Meanings in all the things he encounters. He makes complex calculations to determine when the Tides will make some parts of the House dangerous to him; he remembers the cycles of them so he can get food (a thing previous inhabitants...Thirteen of them, now reduced to bones that he cares for and speaks to and feeds offerings...could or did not master). His wanderings in the Halls are carefully notated in his Journals. But all his skills in this world will not stop The End from coming.\n\nAuthor Clarke begins to crack open Reality and let in the pestiferous Mundane World, and Piranesi really, really Dislikes it. So do I, dear. Especially when the Other's Origin story begins to come clear, with the appearance of someone Piranesi calls the Prophet:\n\n\n\nBut let's be honest. Not one word of this stuff feels false; it's like she's at it again, that Minx of an author, reinventing reality because there's no Reality in it.\n\n\n\n\n\nmight not be a map of the journey, plain and notated onto paper, leading you to the House.

It\u2019s a dreamlike tale stemming from the mind of a visionary author, an author so familiar with genre tropes that she manipulates and subverts them with incredible ease.\n\nIf you, like me, have wondered why everyone seems to be at a loss for words when it comes to describing the plot of this book, be aware that you\u2019ll probably have the same reaction after reading it: there is simply no easy way to pitch it, no quick blurb to draw readers in.\nIt starts off as a weird, albeit intriguing, retelling of the myth of Daedalus's labyrinth, only to expand into dark academia/paranormal thriller territory as the mystery behind Piranesi\u2019s existence slowly unveils. Still, Clarke steers clear of genre conventions, crafting a story whose unique plot and clever twists are unpredictable yet immensely satisfying to the reader.\n\nMuch like many of my favorite fantasy books ( being the first that comes to mind), requires the reader to blindly trust its author and follow an unreliable narrator down a path that will eventually lead to a compelling conclusion. The journey is, however, just as fascinating as the destination. Clarke\u2019s style and narrative voice are reminiscent of 19th century English literature, adding to the otherworldly and timeless atmosphere that permeates the book. The prose is simple yet elegant, like that of a modern Jane Austen.\n\nAbove all, though, what makes this novel worth reading is the way it handles its themes.

The opening chapter is titled 'When the Moon rose in the Third Northern Hall I went to the Ninth Vestibule'. It's written in a particular style, usually found in fantasy or harder SF, which involves a lot of random proper nouns, and I always struggle with that, not least because it immediately gives rise to questions about the logic of how things are named/referred to. (Why is Dog capitalised but bird not; why is it title case Reason and Happiness but lowercase knowledge and imagination, etc., etc.) I was worried it would be whimsical, vague fantasy, and for a while the narrative seemed to bear out that impression...\n\n... but thank god I stuck with it, because it turned out to be exactly the sort of speculative fiction I love most.\n\nThe narrator lives in a vast house composed of hundreds of halls, some of which are often flooded and home to sea life. He believes this house to be the world. He also believes that just fifteen people have ever lived, of which he and another man \u2013 whom he calls the Other \u2013 are the only two remaining. The Other refers to the narrator as 'Piranesi', though he (the narrator) seems to intuit this is not his real name.\n\nPiranesi ekes out a meagre existence in the House. His clothes are rags; he subsists on mussels and dried seaweed. He keeps detailed journals cataloguing every space in the House, and occasionally he helps the Other in his search for what is termed 'the Great and Secret Knowledge'. The Other's rather modern language and use of a 'device', which sounds uncannily like a smartphone, are the first hints that something is amiss in what might otherwise appear to be a world entirely alien from our own.\n\nBeyond that, it's difficult to describe anything about what happens without spoiling the plot, and I think this book is best approached with minimal knowledge. I'll just say it becomes increasingly gripping as it goes along, and when its secrets are revealed, they are ingenious and completely captivating. (There's another good book it really reminds me of, but mentioning that would probably be a spoiler too!)\n\nYou could argue that is the polar opposite of Clarke's wonderful it's short, it has a very small cast of characters, and it takes place in a deliberately enigmatic context rather than a meticulously detailed one. At the same time, it's similar in sly, clever ways, not least through its dry humour.

The descriptions of this world are beyond beautiful.\n\nOnly one other, if you don't count 13 corpses, is his company during most of the novel. The Other is also a scientist of a sort, but he is more interested in the deeper pathways of magic.\n\nI'll tell you though -- this book may not have any outright magic, but we are still steeped in it. It's not merely the descriptions, but these are the core of it. I was frankly blown away from the birds hopping between the statues. The idea that we can see nature as a world that is constantly communicating with us, that we can negotiate with, made me believe that we were either in the deep past or in the realm of the Fae. And more than anything, I just wanted to know what this world was, what was going on, and what was the true mystery.\n\nBeyond this, I will not say, because it is the journey that truly counts.\n\nI still feel the magic here.

It is, in many ways, a work of poetic attunement to the liminal \u2014 the realm of the sub-perceptual and the pre-linguistic.\n\nOn the surface, Piranesi can be described as a work of fantasy. We follow a narrator who lives in a shadowy world known as the House. The House consists of a near endless labyrinth of halls, vestibules, staircases and passages \u2014 some filled with oceanic tides, others enveloped in cloud, all lined with mysterious marble statues. Apart from the narrator, only one other human \u2014 the Other \u2014 lives in the House. Both meet twice a week to discuss a project known as the search for the Great and Secret Knowledge. Without giving too much away, Clarke\u2019s is a carefully orchestrated world full of enchantment, evocation and mystery.\n\nWhat sustains the enterprise are its philosophical undercurrents. The narrator lives in a state of unity with the world around him. He communes with the Dead and the birds that frequent the halls. To him, every day is filled with the promise of wonder and discovery. The Other, by contrast, sees the House as a desolate place, . These observational binaries mediate the book\u2019s themes \u2014 mysticism versus scepticism, the subconscious versus the ego, the world of intrinsic meaning versus the realm of material gain.\n\nI read the book, also, as a tribute to childhood and all that is lost as a byproduct of \u201cprogress\u201d. What would we look like without the burden of social conditioning, without the weight of the ego? The thinkers and references sprinkled throughout the text form important clues here (Rudolf Steiner, Owen Barfield, Plato\u2019s Republic, Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses, and many others).\n\nAnd now I come to my only critique of the book. Had this followed the conventions of literary fiction, the ending would have been less tidy and more ventilated. As it is, the narrative switches gears in a manner that unravels some of its earlier theses. Nevertheless, the House \u2013 with its endless halls, its tides, its internal weather system \u2013 will forever haunt my mind. It is, for me, a reminder of something mythic, peripheral and forgotten.

Nulla di definitivo, ma \u00e8 questo il bello del romanzo, ad ognuno la sua versione.\n\n\n\nIn fondo \u00e8 solo dolore:\nLa Clarke utilizza questa particolare forma di narrazione per proiettarci nella mente disturbata di una vittima di rapimento e abuso spacciandola per racconto dalle tinte fantasy.\nMettete da parte tutte le descrizioni della Casa, sono solamente un complesso costrutto mentale del povero Matthew Rose Sorensen, Piranesi, un rifugio sicuro creato da lui stesso per sopportare e allontanarsi dal tremendo trauma fisico e mentale subito.\n\nI fatti:\nMolti anni prima, lo studente Valentine Ketterley aveva denunciato e fatto arrestare, con l'accusa di rapimento di alcuni studenti scomparsi, il suo ex docente, il mago-scienziato Arne-Sayles, promotore della strana Teoria degli Altri Mondi e figura altamente eccentrica nell'ambiente accademico. Ketterley stesso in seguito avrebbe seguito le orme del suo mentore e compiuto gli stessi crimini, il motivo \u00e8 sconosciuto, forse per follia.\nAnni dopo, il giovane Matthew Sorensen, ricercatore e scrittore, si reca a casa del famoso psicologo Valentine Ketterley per raccogliere informazioni per il suo libro sulla storia dell'eccentrico dottor Arne-Sayles, ma viene ingannato, drogato e imprigionato in un luogo nascosto, forse nelle vicinanze di un certo Battersea Park per anni.\n\nLe prove:\n\n\nMentre Matthew \u00e8 rinchiuso in chiss\u00e0 quale luogo, questo losco figuro, Ketterley, l'Altro, sempre con indosso bei vestiti, gli fa visita ogni tanto per studiare le condizioni psicologiche del suo paziente da lui rinominato Piranesi. Ketterley \u00e8 consapevole dello stato mentale a pezzi di Matthew, senza memoria e ormai del tutto incapace di separare il suo costrutto mentale (la Casa) dal mondo reale. L'Altro, da buon aguzzino, non gli concede nulla, ne vestiti ne informazioni e giocando con la sua memoria perduta si spaccia per suo unico amico, tenendolo li a marcire. Seviziandolo.\nPiranesi non distingue pi\u00f9 la realt\u00e0 al di fuori della Casa, unica vera possibile realt\u00e0 di fuga.\nOgni tanto nota dei particolari esterni come una foglia o un uccello, ma non \u00e8 in grado di tornare alla ragione, non la vuole, ne ha paura. Quale pu\u00f2 essere, se non la propria mente, l'unica ancora di salvezza e difesa alle atrocit\u00e0 subite?\n\n\n\nMolte parole nel racconto sono evidenziate con la Maiuscola perch\u00e9 \u00e8 Piranesi stesso a raccontare e nella sua mente non esiste altro che Se stesso, dove ogni cosa \u00e8 un Simbolo, un Ideale, Memorie perdute.\nQuando il racconto si sposta nel mondo reale le parole non sono pi\u00f9 evidenziate ad indicare la differenza di ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 mentale da ci\u00f2 che non lo \u00e8.\nMatthew/Piranesi \u00e8 una persona molto intelligente. Le date, i nomi delle sale e delle statue e la loro collocazione ed anche i numeri delle infinite sale sono la dimostrazione della sua grande intelligenza che inconsciamente funziona ancora. Purtroppo quello che Piranesi ha dimenticato \u00e8 la sua vita reale. Il trauma \u00e8 troppo forte, \u00e8 ormai isolato in se stesso. Ma sta benissimo, \u00e8 in pace, egli ama stare nella confortevole e infinita Casa. Anche le statue non sono altro che rappresentazioni iconiche dei suoi traballanti ricordi.\n\nNon \u00e8 assolutamente un fantasy e la casa non \u00e8 un luogo fisico e reale, si tratta di un thriller ben mascherato da fantasy in cui si parla, per sviare, di mondi alternativi.\n\nLe ossa dei morti che Piranesi trova nella Casa sono del tutto reali, appartenenti alle precedenti vittime dell'Altro, un folle che forse crede davvero di mandare le sue vittime in un labirinto, che ora gli fanno compagnia nel luogo della sua prigionia, forse una grotta a ridosso del mare? in attesa di aggiungere le sue.\nL'acqua e il mare possono indicare i confini invalicabili della sua mente che ogni tanto cedono alla ragione, non voluta. Le maree forse indicano quei momenti di lucida consapevolezza che distruggerebbero la sua quiete nella Casa e Piranesi le evita con tutto il suo essere, le teme e ne fugge.\n\nLa poliziotta \u00e8 l'unica persona che riesce finalmente a trovarlo, dopo mesi di ricerche nel mondo reale e grazie alla sua particolare inclinazione carismatica e prova e riesce ad entrare in contatto PARLANDO (che Piranesi per\u00f2 immagina siano messaggi) con Matthew. Solo dopo aver sopraffatto, catturato o eliminato il folle maniaco, l'Altro, Piranesi pu\u00f2 tornare infine ad essere Matthew.\nAttenzione, lei, Raphael, la poliziotta, non vede le sale della Casa, mai. \u00c8 Piranesi che VEDE il reale a modo suo e le descrive sotto forma della Casa.\nInoltre, indizio fondamentale, Raphael entra ed esce dalla Casa, cos\u00ec come l'Altro, ad indicare che non \u00e8 un Mondo alternativo raggiungibile con strani rituali, lei non li conosce di certo, \u00e8 invece solo la \"prigione\" creata per auto-protezione dalla mente di Matthew.\n\nPiranesi non pu\u00f2 essere descritto ne caratterizzato meglio, egli stesso parla attraverso la visione della sua mente, cosi come i due personaggi, l'Altro e la ragazza poliziotto, risultano impossibili da caratterizzare maggiormente perch\u00e8 noi vediamo il mondo attraverso la mente di Piranesi ed egli li conosce appena e non \u00e8 in grado di approfondire, fatta eccezione per i mille dettagli della sua meravigliosa e infinita Casa/Mente.\n\nPiranesi non \u00e8 e non sar\u00e0 mai pi\u00f9 in grado di lasciare la Casa totalmente, la sua mente rester\u00e0 comunque ancorata li anche se il suo corpo \u00e8 ormai libero nel mondo reale. L'immaginazione come salvezza e allo stesso tempo prigione di se stessi. Il finale per\u00f2 ci fa sperare in una sua lenta e controllata ripresa.\n\nMagari ho lasciato vagare la mia immaginazione senza freni, ma cos\u00ec' sembra dare un senso al finale che a prima vista appare deludente e affrettato ma che in realt\u00e0 racconta una storia tremenda e non un racconto fantastico.\nLimitarsi ad una spiegazione di mondi alternativi conditi da un mistero risulta insufficiente.\nRingrazio la Clarke per avermi permesso di farlo, non molti riescono nell'impresa.\nCosa volere di pi\u00f9 da un romanzo \"fantasy\"?"}, {"label": "positive", "text": "The Beauty of the House is immesurable; its Kindness infinite.\n\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\n\u2757This review is spoiler-free\u2757\n\n\nI can't believe how long I've been putting off this strange, unique little gem...although I am known to make some questionable choices every so often. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I'm glad I finally read it, though.

He is sweet, kind, caring, and he loves birds \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79 but more often than not he is a little too nice. It was really interesting reading the story solely through his journals. This is another thing I don't usually go for, narration through journals. Most of the time I find it dull and hard to follow. Fortunately, this was not the case with this book. There was something compelling about reading Piranesi's journals, with his methodical, intelligent way of writing and cataloguing his thoughts and infinite knowledge, even though there are some fundamental gaps in his memory evident right from the start. Even though most 1st person narrations are often unreliable, and in this case, I had every reason to doubt him because he doesn't even remember his own name or how old he is and doesn't seem to be too aware of that, I still couldn't help but trust him.\n\nAs for the rest of the characters, those few that are present, they are all fascinating in their own way. The most notable ones, the Other, the Prophet, 16, and the Dead, (awesome nicknames btw) all impact the story (and Piranesi's life) in such a remarkable, confounding manner that left me reeling.

Piranesi, I'll miss you."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "Why you may not like this book: Considering how short this one is compared to Clarke's previous novel, it's nearly funny to say that this is dense. Sure, we don't have the layers of footnotes and sprawling timeline, and roots in history, but in Piranesi, there is a wealth of description and world building of the sort that provides a sprawling labyrinth as both a setting and a feeling. There were times where I also felt a little lost in the halls of and pages of this book. For that reason, this is a book that requires a deeper attention, a close reading, and a bit of being okay stumbling around in the dark for the beginning portions.\n\nThere is a mystery here, something you pick up immediately not because the book announces that we are trying to solve something, but because something is not right. Our main character is missing pieces of his own existence and we are plopped into a world that is a house that is a world, and it needs some explaining. The mystery element is interesting. It feels... delicate? It isn't a layered thing. Again, it feels like we are stumbling in the dark for a long time and then finally, Clarke flips a switch and turns on the lights. If you require your central plots and mysteries more complex, this might feel unsatisfying. I'll also add that that light came on for me before it came on for our main character, so there was a middle portion of this progression where you kind of have to suffer through Piranesi still being in the dark.\n\n: It's so clever. I love books that are descriptive and dense, especially when those descriptions feel meaningful. It isn't just description for the sake of, but in Piranesi, Clarke builds us a world, statue by statue and hall by hall, in order to pack it all with commentary about our world.\n\nI also love books that leave me thinking and that invite me explore themes and meaning. This absolutely does that, and then greets you with a theme of how overwhelming it can be to try and extrapolate meaning from art and the world and our existence. We watch Piranesi the character set about methodically chronically his halls, describing every statue, trying to quantify his world, and yet arrive at the conclusion that the search for knowledge doesn't give value to the world, but that the world is valuable because it is the world.\n\nThere is also so much to take in here as it pertains to perspective and containment, two things that take on different shades of meaning deep, deep into quarantine and isolation. Piranesi is a fascinating character for all the ways he has adapted with boundless cheer and curiosity to his prison. I felt like I both felt sorry for him, wandering endlessly in the same box (same, dude) and envied him the ability to do so cheerfully. It is the dark and light sides of adaptation, the things we as people can get used to and comfortable in. There is a bit of magic at work here for Piranesi, but it resonates, this idea that we could lose so much of anything before that we could fake our way into being happy with the very worst.\n\nI found so many elements of this haunting because of the way it pairs dark and light. I found it a little sad that a vast world with so few people in it is still a world, and so it still has death and violence. And then I found it hopeful that that world is still beautiful and mysterious and full of art and nature. This is a world of perfection and decay, and Clarke describes it all wonderfully and places at the heart of it a fractured man, trying to reconcile past, present, what he did to survive and how that changed him."}, {"label": "positive", "text": "I now have a YouTube channel that I run with my brother, called 'The Brothers Gwynne'.

Part of me was tentative throughout, and slightly puzzled what it was aiming for, but that does not necessarily need to be a negative. This is a book that I think you can get more enjoyment from when going in blind, because I was so, so engaged and interested in watching this story evolve.\n\nBecause of that element of having absolutely no idea how the story is going to evolve, I will not go into too much detail regarding plot or anything that reveals what this story turns into.\n\nPiranesi is set in the real world, but with a supernatural element. Not in terms of out-and-out magic or monsters, but there is a room which is part of the world, but separate at the same time, and it operates by a different set of rules.\n\n\n\nThe story is formed through the diary entries of our central character, Piranesi, whose motivations are incredibly interesting. He grows fantastically throughout this story, with the epistolary form acting to uniquely portray the growth Piranesi goes through in such an original way. The way Piranesi views this unique setting through his introverted personality and the way this evolves and alters as the plot grows was just executed masterfully.\n\nSomehow, Susanna Clarke had me hooked and tense straight away, despite the initial events just really going through the day-to-day life of Piranesi, through his diary accounts. Such an interesting story that I believe has something for everyone, despite being an incredibly weird story. It is a thoroughly enjoyable read that explores a unique setting and had so much depth that made me want to re-read it immediately, and it is also very thought provoking.

It unfolds so perfectly, fitting its self like a puzzle piece. The pacing was pitch perfect and not a single passage dragged on. Clarke writes the book in a like journal entry form that is so fascinating and really makes you feel for our main character, Piranesi.

From the usage of dates in a written form to the formal yet accessible writing she used, every detail and thought mattered.

And that is... pretty much exactly what Piranesi is, so, it's a testament to this book's brilliance that I loved it despite how ill-suited it is to my personal tastes. So if, like me, you read the first page of and groaned because it read like a bunch of gibberish, I'm going to have to implore you to stick with it for a hot second and let it work its magic. (It's short!)\n\nThe thing that quickly won me over is Susanna Clarke's writing and how beautifully-rendered this imaginative setting is. I think it's best to go into knowing as little as possible, so I won't really talk about the plot, but suffice to say it's set in a giant House which is essentially a labyrinth of halls, each lined with hundreds of statues, and in the middle of the House is an ocean. I'm usually not one to relish in descriptive writing but this setting was just so striking, so delightfully offbeat, that I was drawn in pretty effortlessly. As others have said, this book is kind of like a puzzle, but not one that you should race through the book to solve; it's the sort of reading experience that's better savored. \n\nWithout saying too much, what hit me the hardest about this book is its depiction of loneliness. It's ostensibly a cerebral, ethereal, illusory book, but the longer I think about it, the more current and relevant it feels and its inclusion on the Women's Prize longlist makes perfect sense to me.

Whenever I couldn\u2019t read the book because I was busy doing other things, I felt an urge to pick it up again and to continue reading. I just had to know what would happen next and I was driven by this almost compulsory thirst for knowledge. I honestly don\u2019t know how to describe this special brand of reading experience but it definitely was something new for me. The fact the entire book is written in journal entries from Piranesi\u2019s POV added so much character to the story and the reader is right there with the MC, trying to solve a mystery neither the reader nor Prianesi were aware of when the book began. It\u2019s quite the journey, to be honest.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m kind of fighting against myself here because I don\u2019t want to spoil anything, yet at the same time I really want to talk about this amazing book.

I know, I know, I usually write super long reviews so this is extremely hard for me, but this time around I\u2019ll just take one for the team, no matter how much it pains me. XD\n\nWhat I will say, is that I absolutely loved Piranesi as a character and that I adored his child-like nature and the way he saw things. It was beautiful to see this new and strange world though his eyes and to experience how much attention he gave every detail. Piranesi truly cared about the House and I think it\u2019s safe to assume that the House cared about him too. They were a unit and they were both innocent and pure at heart, which might be the reason they worked together so well and had formed some sort of symbiosis. Their interaction was fascinating and extremely lovely to read about. I know this might sound like the house is a character as well and truth be told, for me it actually was. The House is the House and it is. If that makes any sense?!

A very enjoyable book altogether!"}, {"label": "negative", "text": "Weird and unforgivably boring. Its like reading my ATM receipt in Esperanto"}, {"label": "positive", "text": "Piranesi es la historia de un ser tan inocente como misterioso que habita en un mundo conformado por Salas, estatuas colosales  y... Naturaleza. Ah\u00ed, su \u00fanico compa\u00f1ero es El Otro. Pero, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 su mundo es como es? Y, sobre todo, \u00bfc\u00f3mo se obtiene el Gran Conocimiento Secreto?\n\nTermin\u00e9 esta lectura hace varios d\u00edas ya, pero ten\u00eda las ideas revueltas y por mucho que intentara ponerlas en orden, no pod\u00eda. Hasta ahora... M\u00e1s o menos.\n\n\n\n\nNo s\u00e9 ustedes, pero yo cada vez que o\u00eda hablar de Susanna Clarke me imaginaba el tipo de fantas\u00eda que solo leen aquellos que tienen voluntad inquebrantable para acabar libros y yo, por lo general, huyo de los libros que tienen ese aura. Sin embargo, de Clarke no pod\u00eda huir porque su libro me aparec\u00eda hasta en la sopa y aunque a\u00fan no re\u00fano el valor para leerlo, s\u00ed que me pic\u00f3 la curiosidad de conocer la pluma de la autora y decid\u00ed que era el libro indicado para iniciarme con ella.\n\nEl libro est\u00e1 narrado en forma del diario personal de Piranesi, es decir que vemos todo a trav\u00e9s de sus ojos (y sus palabras), lo que nos permite sentirnos como un habitante m\u00e1s de la casa, pero al mismo tiempo nos proh\u00edbe saber m\u00e1s. Sabemos lo que \u00e9l sabe, que no es mucho, ya que Piranesi es un j\u00f3ven que se siente c\u00f3modo donde est\u00e1 y con quien est\u00e1, cuando explora la casa no es para descubrir sus misterios, sino para descubrir sus salas y c\u00f3mo sobrevivir en ellas. As\u00ed es como sabemos que los niveles inferiores son el reino de las mareas, los superiores el de las nubes y los de en medio pertenecen a \u00e9l y a El Otro. Tambi\u00e9n descubrimos que, de vez en cuando, las mareas se desmadran e inundan todo a su paso, pero para Piranesi no es un problema: conoce sus salas tan bien, que sabe cu\u00e1ndo ocurrir\u00e1n las inundaciones y c\u00f3mo salir de su camino. Y esto no lo menciono porque s\u00ed, sino porque tiene relevancia en la trama y, adem\u00e1s, me sirve para pasar a mi interpretaci\u00f3n.\n\nSi bien la autora dijo que esta historia no tiene nada que ver con su estado de confinamiento, que la idea surgi\u00f3 mucho antes y que la inspiraci\u00f3n viene de Borges, yo no pude evitar encontrar muchas referencias a la soledad. \u00bfLas inundaciones, las incontables menciones al mar y su furia? Bien podr\u00edan ser una referencia a esas brechas mentales que ocurren cuando sentirnos solos nos supera. Nos preparamos para ello, casi siempre sabemos cu\u00e1ndo va ocurrir y luego, cuando la calma vuelve, le damos gracias a la \"casa\" (t\u00fa mismo, Dios, la Tierra, el universo; no importa) por estar vivos.  Por otro lado, en varios fragmentos se muestra a Piranesi consol\u00e1ndose a s\u00ed mismo y d\u00e1ndose \u00e1nimos solo, buscando afecto en animales u objetos inanimados que claramente no pueden d\u00e1rselo y, al mismo tiempo, amando la tranquilidad y la libertad que lo rodean a tal punto que se siente afortunado de poder disfrutar todas esas cosas sin interrupciones.\n\nClaro que, si empezamos a buscar significados, podemos hacer que hasta una roca sea la cosa m\u00e1s abstracta. As\u00ed como yo he encontrado referencias a la soledad hay una persona que me dijo que encontr\u00f3 referencias a la ansiedad, le\u00ed rese\u00f1as que pensaban en relaciones t\u00f3xicas y otras que encontraron una historia de fantasia pura. As\u00ed que no me hagan mucho caso.\n\nNo voy a mentir, cuando empiezas el libro s\u00ed resulta confuso, pero poco a poco te vas dando cuenta de que la trama sigue un hilo muy sencillo. No es m\u00e1s que Piranesi descubriendo cosas, sobre la casa, sobre El Otro, sobre \u00e9l mismo. Pan comido. No le tengan miedo. No sean yo.\n\nSobre los personajes, El Otro me cay\u00f3 mal nada m\u00e1s conocerlo. Eso es mucho decir considerando que lo conoc\u00ed a trav\u00e9s de la percepci\u00f3n de Piranesi, que ve todo color de rosa. Su actitud, su... No s\u00e9, como que ten\u00eda un aura repelente y por mucho que le hiciera obsequios a Piranesi y se preocupara por su salud, no me ca\u00eda bien. La descripci\u00f3n simple de \u00e9l es la siguiente: un hombre mayor, obsesionado con obtener el Gran Conocimiento Secreto y que de vez en cuando se porta bien con Piranesi. No voy a decir que es un personaje que est\u00e1 de m\u00e1s, porque no, aqu\u00ed ninguno est\u00e1 de m\u00e1s. Lo que pasa que no he logrado simpatizar con \u00e9l en ning\u00fan momento y eso repercuti\u00f3 un poco en mi apreciaci\u00f3n de la historia.\n\nPiranesi es un sol... Y creo que cualquier otra descripci\u00f3n estar\u00eda equivocada. No es que no tenga su lado oscuro, porque lo tiene, pero es tan bueno que hasta se asegura de que los cad\u00e1veres que hay en la casa est\u00e9n bien cuidaditos y atendidos. Es distra\u00eddo, infantil e impulsivo, pero tambi\u00e9n astuto. Verlo enfrentarse a los problemas que surgen te hace quererlo m\u00e1s. Fue por \u00e9l que me qued\u00f3 un vac\u00edo tan grande luego de acabar el libro, porque no ten\u00eda idea c\u00f3mo sentirme sabiendo que no volver\u00eda a leerlo, que no habr\u00eda una segunda parte, que nunca volver\u00eda a leer sobre sus impresiones. Espero que se note lo mucho que quiero a este personaje, que no es que sea mi , no va por ah\u00ed, sino que... me hac\u00eda sentir tan orgullosa de \u00e9l cuando lo le\u00eda, me hac\u00eda creer que el mundo s\u00ed que tiene un mont\u00f3n de cosas buenas y que todo puede estar bien. Se merece todo lo bueno del mundo. Punto.\n\nLa forma en lo que todo acaba es perfecta, cada cosa cae en su sitio e incluso lo que no se dice contribuye a que el final sea ideal.\n\nEn lo negativo, me duele decirlo, pero aunque este es un libro corto, siento que le sobraron p\u00e1ginas y que hay ciertas... cosas... que no aportaron nada a la trama y solo aparecieron de la nada para darle un aire rom\u00e1ntico a una historia que ni siquiera necesitaba de eso para ser hermosa."}]
